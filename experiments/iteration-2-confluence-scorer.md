# Iteration 2: Rule-Based Confluence Scorer

## Hypothesis
A weighted scoring system selecting strategies based on ICT confluence factors will be more robust than the RL meta-agent because it cannot overfit.

## Implementation Summary
- Confluence Scorer with 10 factors, threshold=3.5
- Walk-forward validation: 28 windows per symbol
- Symbols: BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, SOLUSDT
- Commission: 0.1% per side
- Slippage: 0.05% per side
- Max position hold: 100 bars

### Confluence Weights
| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Structure Alignment | 2 |
| Kill Zone Active | 0.5 |
| Liquidity Sweep | 2 |
| OB Proximity | 1 |
| FVG at CE | 1 |
| Recent BOS | 1 |
| R:R Ratio | 1.5 |
| OTE Zone | 0.5 |
| Breaker Confluence | 0 |
| OB+FVG Confluence | 1 |

**Max possible score:** 10.5
**Threshold:** 3.5

## Results

### Walk-Forward Summary
| Symbol | Windows | Positive | Avg Sharpe | Worst Sharpe | Status |
|--------|---------|----------|------------|--------------|--------|
| BTCUSDT | 28 | 8/28 | 146.31 | -397.56 | FAIL |
| ETHUSDT | 33 | 16/33 | -59.30 | -783.28 | FAIL |
| SOLUSDT | 33 | 20/33 | -8.85 | -182.24 | FAIL |


**Overall pass rate:** 46.8%
**Overall verdict:** FAILED

### Per-Strategy Breakdown
| Strategy | Signals | Trades | Wins | Losses | Win Rate | Avg PnL | Total PnL |
|----------|---------|--------|------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|
| order_block | 1185 | 481 | 197 | 284 | 41.0% | -0.22% | -105.76% |
| fvg | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0% | 0.00% | 0.00% |
| bos_continuation | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0% | 0.00% | 0.00% |
| choch_reversal | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0% | 0.00% | 0.00% |


**Total trades:** 481
**Overall win rate:** 41.0%
**Overall PnL:** -79.09%

### Comparison to RL (exp-014)

## Key Learnings
- **Low win rate (41.0%).** May need to increase threshold or add additional filters.
- **order_block** is the most active strategy (481 trades, 41.0% win rate).
- **Dead strategies (0 trades):** fvg, bos_continuation, choch_reversal. These may need looser entry conditions or the confluence threshold may be filtering them out.
- **Failed symbols:** BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, SOLUSDT. The confluence scorer may need symbol-specific weight tuning.
- **Signal-to-trade conversion:** 40.6% (481 trades from 1185 signals above threshold).

## Decision: Pivot -- fundamental approach may need rethinking. Consider different confluence factors or entry logic.

## Impact on Next Iteration
The scorer needs adjustment before proceeding. Focus areas:
1. Analyze which factors contribute most to winning trades
2. Consider lowering threshold to increase trade count
3. Review strategy entry conditions for each failing symbol
