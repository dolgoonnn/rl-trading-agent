# Iteration 2: Rule-Based Confluence Scorer

## Hypothesis
A weighted scoring system selecting strategies based on ICT confluence factors will be more robust than the RL meta-agent because it cannot overfit.

## Implementation Summary
- Confluence Scorer with 10 factors, threshold=4.048
- Walk-forward validation: 33 windows per symbol
- Symbols: BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, SOLUSDT
- Commission: 0.1% per side
- Slippage: 0.05% per side
- Max position hold: 160 bars

### Confluence Weights
| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Structure Alignment | 2 |
| Kill Zone Active | 0.5 |
| Liquidity Sweep | 2 |
| OB Proximity | 1 |
| FVG at CE | 1 |
| Recent BOS | 1 |
| R:R Ratio | 1.5 |
| OTE Zone | 0.5 |
| Breaker Confluence | 0 |
| OB+FVG Confluence | 1 |

**Max possible score:** 10.5
**Threshold:** 4.048

## Results

### Walk-Forward Summary
| Symbol | Windows | Positive | Avg Sharpe | Worst Sharpe | Status |
|--------|---------|----------|------------|--------------|--------|
| BTCUSDT | 33 | 23/33 | 23.45 | -237.25 | FAIL |
| ETHUSDT | 33 | 20/33 | -28.81 | -801.23 | FAIL |
| SOLUSDT | 33 | 26/33 | 9.35 | -115.64 | FAIL |


**Overall pass rate:** 69.7%
**Overall verdict:** FAILED

### Per-Strategy Breakdown
| Strategy | Signals | Trades | Wins | Losses | Win Rate | Avg PnL | Total PnL |
|----------|---------|--------|------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|
| order_block | 3311 | 588 | 271 | 317 | 46.1% | 0.56% | 326.89% |
| fvg | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0% | 0.00% | 0.00% |
| bos_continuation | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0% | 0.00% | 0.00% |
| choch_reversal | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0% | 0.00% | 0.00% |


**Total trades:** 588
**Overall win rate:** 46.1%
**Overall PnL:** 1021.20%

### Comparison to RL (exp-014)
_No exp-014 RL results found for comparison. Run walk-forward-validate.ts with the RL model first._


## Key Learnings
- **Moderate win rate (46.1%).** Acceptable if average winners exceed average losers.
- **order_block** is the most active strategy (588 trades, 46.1% win rate).
- **Dead strategies (0 trades):** fvg, bos_continuation, choch_reversal. These may need looser entry conditions or the confluence threshold may be filtering them out.
- **Failed symbols:** BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, SOLUSDT. The confluence scorer may need symbol-specific weight tuning.
- **Signal-to-trade conversion:** 17.8% (588 trades from 3311 signals above threshold).

## Decision: Adjust -- the system shows promise but needs threshold/weight tuning before proceeding

## Impact on Next Iteration
The scorer needs adjustment before proceeding. Focus areas:
1. Analyze which factors contribute most to winning trades
2. Consider lowering threshold to increase trade count
3. Review strategy entry conditions for each failing symbol
