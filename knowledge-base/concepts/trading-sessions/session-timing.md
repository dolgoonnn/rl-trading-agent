# Trading Sessions and Timing

## Definition

Trading sessions are specific windows during the trading day when institutional activity is highest. Each session has characteristic highs and lows that become liquidity targets for intraday traders.

## Key Sessions (New York Local Time)

### Asian Session
- **Time**: 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM (previous day)
- **Focus**: Light volume, wide spreads
- **Use**: Note the session high/low for next day targeting

### London Session
- **Time**: 2:00 AM - 5:00 AM
- **Focus**: Increased European volatility
- **Use**: Session high/low often swept during New York open
- **Key setup**: Price often runs above London highs or below London lows when NY session opens

### New York Session
- **Time**: 7:00 AM - 10:00 AM
- **Focus**: HIGHEST volume, most reliable setups
- **Best timeframe**: 1-3 minute charts
- **Key setup**: Session high/low often swept, strong directional moves form

### Equity Open Impact
- **Time**: 9:30 AM
- **Impact**: Additional volatility as stock market opens
- **Setup**: Look for setups right before 9:30 or right after

### Mid-Morning to Noon
- **Time**: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM (Noon)
- **Best for setups**: 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM window
- **After Noon**: Generally avoid trading (problematic price action)

### Afternoon Session
- **Time**: 1:30 PM - 4:00 PM
- **Opportunity**: Secondary setup window
- **Best time**: 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM typically shows trend development

## Optimal Trading Window

**Primary**: 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM (NY local time)
- Highest quality setups
- Best liquidity
- Clearest price action

**Secondary**: 1:30 PM - 4:00 PM
- Can provide additional setups
- Generally less volatile than morning

**Avoid**: Noon - 1:30 PM (NY lunch hour)

## How to Use Session Times

1. On each trading day, note the London session high/low (2 AM - 5 AM)
2. Note the early New York session high/low (7 AM - pre-equity open)
3. Mark these levels on your 15-minute chart
4. Expect price to sweep these levels during prime NY session (8:30-11 AM)
5. Look for setups around these swept levels

## Trading Application

1. Focus your live trading between 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM NY time
2. If you can't watch live, use TradingView replay to study the morning session
3. Track how price interacts with previous session highs/lows
4. These sweeps create setups consistent with your methodology
5. Limit afternoon trading until you master morning session

## Trading Rules

- Most reliable setups occur 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM
- Don't force trades outside optimal windows
- Session highs/lows are key liquidity targets
- Price typically sweeps London lows/highs during NY morning
- Avoid the noon hour - too choppy/unreliable

## Common Mistakes

- Trading after noon without understanding the nuances
- Ignoring session times and trading randomly
- Not noting previous session highs/lows
- Over-trading outside the 8:30-11 AM window
- Missing sweeps because levels aren't marked
