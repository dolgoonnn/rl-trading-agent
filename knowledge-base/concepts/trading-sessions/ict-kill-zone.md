# ICT Kill Zone

## Definition

The ICT Kill Zone is a specific time window when institutional traders are most active and setups are most likely to form. For Forex markets, this is the **New York Morning Session: 7:00 AM - 10:00 AM New York Local Time**.

## Why "Kill Zone"?

This is when setups are:
- Most likely to form
- Highest probability for traders
- Named for the "killing" of obvious trading opportunities

## Kill Zone Times (New York Local Time)

### Primary Kill Zone (Forex)
- **7:00 AM - 10:00 AM NY local time**
- When institutional algorithms are most active
- Highest volume and most reliable price delivery

### London Kill Zone (Optional)
- **2:00 AM - 5:00 AM NY local time**
- Lower volume, but available for advanced traders

## Key Principles

**Time matters more than anything:**
- Algorithms operate on time AND price (in that order)
- Specific times trigger specific algorithmic behaviors
- Price delivery is most efficient during kill zone

**What to Expect:**
- Clear FVG formations
- Strong displacement moves
- Clean order block formations
- Minimal choppy/sloppy price action

## Application for Forex

1. Set TradingView to **New York Local Time** (critical!)
2. Mark vertical line at 7:00 AM
3. Mark vertical line at 10:00 AM
4. Only hunt setups during this window
5. Apply FVG + Market Structure Break logic as you would for indices

## Why Not Other Times?

- **Asian Session**: Too light, low volume, unreliable
- **London Open**: Good, but secondary to NY morning
- **NY Afternoon**: Generally available but requires more precision
- **Overnight**: Random, unpredictable

## Application Rules

- Don't trade outside kill zone until you're advanced
- Kill zone = where 80% of your learning should focus
- Quality over quantity: 1 setup in kill zone > 10 outside it
- Test everything within kill zone timeframe
