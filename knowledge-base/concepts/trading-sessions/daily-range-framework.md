# Daily Range Framework

## Definition

The daily range framework divides the trading day into three distinct windows: Morning session (high volatility, best setups), Lunch hour (no trading), and Afternoon session (continuation moves).

## The Three Windows (New York Local Time)

### Morning Session: 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM
- **Characteristics**: Highest volume, most reliable setups
- **Focus**: Swing highs/lows BEFORE 8:30, then hunt them
- **Stops**: Buy stops above old highs, sell stops below old lows
- **Exit**: Preferably before 11:00 AM

### Lunch Hour: 12:00 PM (Noon) - 1:00 PM
- **Characteristics**: CHOPPY, unpredictable, avoid trading
- **Why**: Lower volume, algorithms pausing
- **Action**: Close positions or sit on sidelines
- **Never**: Enter new trades during this hour

### Afternoon Session: 1:30 PM - 4:00 PM
- **Characteristics**: Secondary setup window
- **Best time**: 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM typically shows trends
- **Special times**: 20 minutes before close (3:40), at close (4:00)
- **Pattern**: Market-on-Close orders create acceleration

## Setting Up Charts

### Steps
1. Set TradingView to **New York local time**
2. Mark 8:30 AM vertical line
3. Mark noon vertical line
4. Mark 1:30 PM vertical line
5. Divide into three equal zones (morning, lunch, afternoon)

## Session Characteristics

**Morning Trend**
- Can be bullish, bearish, or consolidation
- Sets the tone for the day

**Afternoon Development**
- Typically continues morning bias
- May show "measured move" (duplicates morning move)
- Can also reverse if morning was consolidation

## Measured Move Pattern

If morning moves up 200 points:
- Afternoon may also move up another 200 points
- Total daily range could be 400 points

## Optimal Trading Times

**Primary**: 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM
- Tightest stops
- Clearest price delivery

**Secondary**: 1:30 PM - 4:00 PM
- Requires confirmation of daily bias
- Less volatile than morning

**AVOID**: Noon - 1:30 PM and after 4:00 PM

## Trading Application

1. Before 8:30: Identify swing highs/lows to target
2. At 8:30: Look for stop hunt above old highs or below old lows
3. 8:30-11:00: Execute primary setups
4. Noon-1:00: Flat (no trades)
5. 1:30 onward: Enter afternoon continuation IF bias is clear
6. Before close: Watch for acceleration into close

## Source Notes

> "Your morning trade is between 8:30 in the morning all the way to noon preferably around 11:00 I generally don't like to take trades after 11 o'clock... that hour [noon-1pm] is usually very problematic and it just it's better not to even look for any kind of setups."
