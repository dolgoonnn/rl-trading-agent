# Intermediate Term High/Low (ITH/ITL)

## Definition

An Intermediate Term High (ITH) or Intermediate Term Low (ITL) is a swing point that forms specifically at the rebalancing of an imbalance (Fair Value Gap). These swing points sit between short-term and long-term swing points in the market structure hierarchy and are key to understanding price direction.

## Key Principle

**Every time a Fair Value Gap is rebalanced, the swing point created at that moment becomes an Intermediate Term High or Low.**

## Formation Rules

### Intermediate Term Low (ITL)
An ITL forms when:
- An upward imbalance (bullish FVG) is created
- Price retraces back down to rebalance that gap
- The low formed at that rebalancing point is the ITL
- Should have a higher short-term low to both left and right

### Intermediate Term High (ITH)
An ITH forms when:
- A downward imbalance (bearish FVG) is created
- Price retraces back up to rebalance that gap
- The high formed at that rebalancing point is the ITH
- Should have a lower short-term high to both left and right

## Structure Hierarchy

```
Long-Term High (framed by higher timeframe level)
    ↓
    Intermediate Term High (forms at FVG rebalance)
        ↓
        Short-Term High (standard swing high)
            ↓
            Short-Term Low (standard swing low)
        ↓
    Intermediate Term Low (forms at FVG rebalance)
    ↓
Long-Term Low (framed by higher timeframe level)
```

## Failed ITH/ITL Pattern

A critical insight: When an Intermediate Term High fails to be higher than both adjacent short-term highs, or when an ITL fails to be lower than both adjacent short-term lows, this indicates directional bias:

### Bearish Signal
```
         STH (higher)
          ↓
    ─────────── ITH ←── ITH is NOT the highest
          ↓                (fails to exceed STH)
         STH (lower)
          ↓
         ⬇️ Bearish - market is going lower
```

When the ITH is not higher than both short-term highs:
- The market is showing weakness on rallies
- Expect continuation lower
- Use this as confirmation for bearish trades

### Bullish Signal
When the ITL is not lower than both short-term lows:
- The market is showing strength on dips
- Expect continuation higher
- Use this as confirmation for bullish trades

## Trading Application

1. **Identify the higher timeframe bias** (daily chart level)
2. **Mark imbalances** (Fair Value Gaps) on your trading timeframe
3. **Watch for rebalancing** - when price returns to fill the gap
4. **Classify the swing** - the high/low at rebalance is an ITH/ITL
5. **Assess the failure pattern** - is the ITH below the STHs?
6. **Trade the direction** indicated by the pattern

## Targeting with ITH/ITL

Once price breaks below an ITL (or above an ITH), you can use the range between:
- Long-Term High to Long-Term Low
- Or Intermediate Term High to Long-Term Low

Anchor your Fibonacci from the ITH down to the Long-Term Low for bearish projections:
- Use -1 to -1.5 standard deviation for targets
- The ITH is the anchor because that's where the swing decline begins

## Key Insight

> "The idea of an intermediate term high not being higher than the short-term high to the left of it or the short-term high to the right of it - in other words it's going lower... this is what I discovered in my own study. No one taught this to me."

This failed intermediate term high/low pattern reveals the market's hand before the major move occurs.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating every swing high/low as equal (ignoring the hierarchy)
- Not waiting for the FVG rebalance to confirm the ITH/ITL
- Ignoring the relationship between ITH and adjacent short-term highs
- Using random swing points instead of those formed at rebalancing
