# Premium and Discount

## Definition

Premium and Discount divides any price range into two zones using the 50% level (equilibrium). Price above 50% is "Premium" (expensive), price below 50% is "Discount" (cheap). This framework guides when to buy and when to sell.

## Key Characteristics

- Based on the 50% level of any range
- Premium = above 50% (expensive) → look to sell
- Discount = below 50% (cheap) → look to buy
- Algorithms seek to move from premium to discount and vice versa

## The Framework

```
HIGH ──────────────────────────
     │                        │
     │      PREMIUM           │  ← Sell Zone (expensive)
     │      (Above 50%)       │
     │                        │
50%  ├────────────────────────┤  ← Equilibrium
     │                        │
     │      DISCOUNT          │  ← Buy Zone (cheap)
     │      (Below 50%)       │
     │                        │
LOW  ──────────────────────────
```

## How to Apply

1. Identify the relevant range (daily high/low, swing high/low)
2. Use Fibonacci tool: drag from low to high (or high to low)
3. Mark the 50% level
4. If bearish: entries should be in premium (above 50%)
5. If bullish: entries should be in discount (below 50%)

## The Liquidity Matrix

When planning trades:
1. Determine if you're in premium or discount
2. Identify targets in the opposing zone
3. For shorts: enter in premium, target discount
4. For longs: enter in discount, target premium

## Trading Application

1. Mark the range you're trading within
2. Identify the 50% equilibrium level
3. If bearish, wait for price to be in premium before shorting
4. Target old lows, sell stops, or FVGs in discount
5. If bullish, wait for price to be in discount before buying
6. Target old highs, buy stops, or FVGs in premium

## Trading Rules

- Never buy in premium when looking for longs
- Never sell in discount when looking for shorts
- Entry in opposing zone = better risk:reward
- Targets should be in the opposite zone from entry
- The 50% level itself can act as support/resistance

## Common Mistakes

- Buying at highs (premium) expecting higher prices
- Selling at lows (discount) expecting lower prices
- Ignoring premium/discount context for "good-looking" setups
- Not adjusting range as price develops new highs/lows
