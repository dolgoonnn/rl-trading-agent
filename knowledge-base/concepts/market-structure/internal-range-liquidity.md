# Internal Range Liquidity

## Definition

Internal Range Liquidity refers to short-term swing highs and lows that form WITHIN a larger price leg. These interior levels become targets for price retracement and are important for intraday trading on lower timeframes.

## Key Characteristics

- Forms within a trending price move
- Short-term highs/lows with buy/sell stops above/below
- Price often retraces back into this range
- Becomes part of order block identification
- Most relevant on 1-3 minute charts

## Structure

### Example: Bearish Price Leg
```
Larger Downtrend
│
├─ High (buy stops above)
│    │
│    ├─ Swing High (internal)
│    └─ Swing Low ← Internal Range Liquidity
│         │
│         └─ Sell stops below
│
└─ Low (major support)
```

### Where Internal Liquidity Hides

Within a downward price move:
- Short-term swing HIGH (has buy stops above it)
- Short-term swing LOW (has sell stops below it)
- Fair Value Gap (imbalance within the range)

## Trading Application

1. Identify larger price leg direction
2. Look for swing highs/lows forming within that leg
3. Mark where liquidity pools would rest (above highs, below lows)
4. Expect price to retrace into this range
5. Use internal range levels as additional entry points

## How to Find Them

1. Switch to 1-3 minute chart
2. Look for a trending move (up or down)
3. Within that move, identify the swing high and swing low
4. This swing high/low IS your internal range liquidity
5. Mark it for potential retracement targets

## Trading Rules

- Internal liquidity forms in ALL timeframes
- More useful on lower timeframes (1-3 min)
- Retracements into internal range are normal
- Don't confuse with major support/resistance
- Part of larger market structure context

## Common Mistakes

- Mistaking internal range for reversal point
- Not recognizing retracements as natural price action
- Over-trading every internal level
- Ignoring higher timeframe context
