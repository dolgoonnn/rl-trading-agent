# Intermarket Relationships and Divergence

## Definition

Intermarket relationships examine how the **Dow, S&P 500, and NASDAQ** move in correlation with each other. Divergence between these indices provides confirmation of directional moves.

## The Three Indices

### Dow (YM)
- 30 blue-chip stocks
- Largest, least volatile
- "Leading indicator" (moves first)

### S&P 500 (ES)
- 500 stocks (broader market)
- Middle ground volatility
- "Confirmation" (follows Dow)

### NASDAQ (NQ)
- Tech-heavy, 100 stocks
- Highest volatility
- Most price range (best for scalping)

## Normal Correlation

These three markets typically **move together in the same direction** during the same session:
- When Dow rallies, S&P rallies, NASDAQ rallies
- When Dow sells off, S&P sells off, NASDAQ sells off

This is **correlated movement** (boats rising/falling with tide).

## Divergence (The Signal)

Divergence occurs when one index does NOT follow the others:

### Bearish Divergence Example
```
NASDAQ: ↓ (makes new low)
S&P 500: ↓ (makes new low)
DOW:     ↔ (DOES NOT make new low) ← DIVERGENCE

Interpretation: Dow unwillingness = Accumulation
                = Likely to rally
```

### Bullish Divergence Example
```
NASDAQ: ↑ (makes new high)
S&P 500: ↑ (makes new high)
DOW:     ↔ (DOES NOT make new high) ← DIVERGENCE

Interpretation: Dow unwillingness = Distribution
                = Likely to sell off
```

## What Divergence Really Means

**It's NOT buying/selling pressure.**

**It's algorithmic unwillingness to deliver price in one direction.**

When Dow doesn't make the same low as NASDAQ/S&P:
- Algorithm is saying "no, we're not going there"
- This "crack in correlation" = intention change
- Prices will reverse to the Dow's level

## How to Use Divergence

### As Confirmation (NOT Standalone Signal)

Divergence CONFIRMS an idea you already have:

```
You already expect: BULLISH on daily chart
You see in price: NASDAQ/S&P made lower low
You check DOW: DOW did NOT make lower low

Divergence confirms: This low was a stop hunt
                     Real move is higher
                     → Enter long
```

### What NOT to Do

❌ Don't trade JUST because you see divergence
❌ Don't assume divergence = automatic reversal
❌ Don't enter without other confluence (FVG, order block)

## Trading Application

1. Establish daily bias from daily chart
2. During intraday movement, check correlation
3. If one index diverges, note it
4. Combine with your other confluence (FVG, swing breaks)
5. Enter with confidence of divergence confirmation

## The Macro Concept

ICT mentions there are **"macros"** (algorithmic programs) that run at specific times:
- 8:30 AM news event
- 1:30 PM (afternoon session start)
- 20 minutes before close
- At 4:00 PM close

Divergence can indicate when macros are engaged (unwillingness to follow typical pattern).

## Common Mistakes

- Treating divergence as a standalone trading signal
- Expecting automatic reversal after divergence
- Ignoring that divergence requires other confluence
- Not understanding it's confirmation, not initiation
- Over-relying on divergence instead of price structure

## Source Notes

> "If you're looking at a period of time and an area in price action that maybe is going under accumulation for long positions... I'm looking for that little fingerprint of the algorithm... Dow is unwillingness to go lower than that low that tips off individuals that are looking for cracks and correlation."

> "When that occurs right when the NASDAQ and the S&P are trading below its old low... this is what I'm looking for... the Dow didn't make a lower low where the S&P and NASDAQ did."

> "You anticipated already you're not looking for this... you're already looking for a reason to go higher so that means you're looking at an old low."
