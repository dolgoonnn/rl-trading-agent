# Market Structure Break (MSB)

## Definition

A Market Structure Break occurs when price breaks below a short-term swing low (bearish) or above a short-term swing high (bullish). This signals a potential change in the immediate price direction and creates the context for entry setups.

## Key Characteristics

- Confirms directional bias on lower timeframes
- Creates Fair Value Gaps that become entry points
- Must occur AFTER liquidity has been taken
- Provides the "trigger" for trade entry

## Structure

### Bearish Market Structure Break
```
       ╱╲
      ╱  ╲      Swing High (liquidity taken above here)
     ╱    ╲
    ╱      ╲
           ╲
    ────────╳──── Short-term Low (swing low)
             ╲
              ╲  ← BREAK below swing low = MSB
               ╲
                ╲  Now looking for FVG entry to short
```

### Bullish Market Structure Break
```
               ╱  Now looking for FVG entry to long
              ╱
             ╱   ← BREAK above swing high = MSB
    ────────╳──── Short-term High (swing high)
           ╱

## Swing Point Definition

A swing low requires:
- Candle with higher low to the left
- Candle with higher low to the right
- The middle candle is the swing low

A swing high requires:
- Candle with lower high to the left
- Candle with lower high to the right
- The middle candle is the swing high

## The Complete Sequence

1. **Liquidity Sweep**: Price takes buy stops (for bearish) or sell stops (for bullish)
2. **Market Structure Break**: Price breaks below swing low (bearish) or above swing high (bullish)
3. **Fair Value Gap Forms**: The break creates an imbalance
4. **Entry**: Price retraces into the FVG

## Trading Application

1. Establish weekly/daily bias (higher timeframe direction)
2. Wait for liquidity to be swept (opposite direction)
3. Drop to lower timeframe (1-3 minute)
4. Watch for swing low/high to be broken
5. Identify the FVG created by the break
6. Enter when price retraces into FVG

## Trading Rules

- MSB alone is NOT an entry signal
- MSB must occur AFTER liquidity sweep
- The FVG from the MSB is the actual entry
- Do not chase price after MSB - wait for retrace
- MSB confirms the "hand has been tipped"

## Common Mistakes

- Entering on MSB without waiting for FVG retrace
- Looking for MSB before liquidity has been taken
- Using MSB against higher timeframe bias
- Confusing minor breaks with significant MSB

> "The market creates a short-term low here and then it breaks below that this is key this is called a break in Market structure... once this low is broken you're going to look for this little area here that's that imbalance."

> "Once this occurs on that higher time frame 15-minute time frame you want to drop down to the lower time frames... we have a short-term swing low... if you have that and then you have a break below that if it happens that creates a gap like this that's what you're looking for."
