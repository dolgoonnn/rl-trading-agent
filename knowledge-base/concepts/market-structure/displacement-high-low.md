# Displacement High and Low

## Definition

The **Displacement High** and **Displacement Low** are the extreme price points created by an energetic, displaced price move that breaks through a short-term level with conviction.

- **Displacement High**: The high of the aggressive move above an old high
- **Displacement Low**: The low of the aggressive move below an old low

## Why They Matter

The range between Displacement High and Displacement Low contains the Fair Value Gap that becomes your entry point.

## Structure

### Bearish Setup Example
```
OLD HIGH ────────────────
         │
         │ Retail buys thinking breakout
         │
         ↑ DISPLACEMENT HIGH (aggressively above old high)
         │
         │ Then market reverses aggressively downward
         │
         ↓ DISPLACEMENT LOW (aggressively below short-term low)
         │
      ┌──┴──┐
      │ FVG │  ← Fair Value Gap is in this range
      └──┬──┘
         │
    SHORT ENTRY ← Trade into the gap
```

### How to Identify

**Bearish (Looking for short):**
1. Market runs above old high or relative equal highs
2. Market breaks down below short-term low with **energetic movement**
3. Look at the HIGH created during the upward run = Displacement High
4. Look at the LOW created during the downward break = Displacement Low
5. FVG lives between these two prices

**Bullish (Looking for long):**
1. Market runs below old low or relative equal lows
2. Market breaks up above short-term high with **energetic movement**
3. Displacement Low = Low of the downward run
4. Displacement High = High of the upward break
5. FVG lives between these two prices

## Key Principle

**You must see DISPLACEMENT (energetic, animated movement), not just any move through a level.**

- Weak move through level = not significant
- Displaced move = obvious, violent, energetic = significant

## The FVG Location

The Fair Value Gap will form BETWEEN:
- The Displacement High and Displacement Low range
- Specifically in the area that was "skipped" by the displaced move

## Trading Application

1. Wait for clear old high or short-term high formation
2. Wait for run above it (not too worried about this)
3. Wait for ENERGETIC break below short-term low (displacement)
4. Identify the range: Displacement High to Displacement Low
5. Look for FVG in that range
6. Enter when price retraces into the FVG

## Trading Rules

- Weak breaks do NOT create significant trade setups
- Displaced breaks create clear FVGs
- FVG must form between the displacement levels
- If no FVG forms in displacement range = no trade
- Every trading day produces these patterns (both directions)

## Common Mistakes

- Confusing weak moves with displaced moves
- Looking for FVG before displacement occurs
- Entering without waiting for clear displacement
- Trading weak setups because "it looks like FVG"
