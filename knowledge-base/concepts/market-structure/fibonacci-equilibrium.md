# Fibonacci Equilibrium (50% Level)

## Definition

The Fibonacci 50% level divides any price range into two equal zones: Premium (above 50%) and Discount (below 50%). This equilibrium acts as a balancing point for price direction.

## How to Mark It

1. On TradingView, select the Fibonacci tool
2. Click at the daily low, drag to the daily high
3. The 50% level is your equilibrium

## The Two Zones

**Premium (Above 50%)**
- Price is expensive
- Territory for short entries when bearish
- Buyers paying high prices

**Discount (Below 50%)**
- Price is cheap
- Territory for long entries when bullish
- Sellers accepting low prices

## Trading Application

1. Mark the daily range low to high
2. Identify the 50% level
3. If you expect higher prices: enter in discount, target premium
4. If you expect lower prices: enter in premium, target discount
5. Use the 50% as your first target or support/resistance

## Trading Rules

- Markets gravitate from premium to discount (and vice versa)
- Never fight the equilibrium expectation
- If bullish, let it trade to 50% minimum before exiting
- If bearish, same approach
