# Weekly Bias

## Definition

Weekly bias is your expectation of whether the next weekly candle will expand higher or lower. This sets the foundation for all lower timeframe analysis and trade direction.

## Key Characteristics

- Determined BEFORE the trading week begins (preferably on weekends)
- You are NOT trying to predict the weekly close
- Focus on which direction the candle is likely to EXPAND
- Sets the directional filter for all intraday trades

## How to Determine Weekly Bias

1. **Seasonality**: Certain times of year have predictable tendencies
2. **Fundamental backdrop**: Interest rate expectations, earnings season, economic data
3. **Market structure**: Is the weekly chart in an uptrend or downtrend?
4. **Key levels**: Where are the nearest liquidity pools (old highs/lows)?

## Trading Application

1. On weekends, analyze the weekly chart
2. Determine if next week's candle is likely to expand higher or lower
3. Only take trades in the direction of your weekly bias
4. If expecting lower prices → only look for short setups
5. If expecting higher prices → only look for long setups

## Trading Rules

- Do not try to predict the exact weekly close
- One directional move per week is often enough
- If you catch one setup aligned with weekly bias, you're done
- Do not trade every session every day
- Consistency comes from patience, not frequency

## Common Mistakes

- Trying to trade both directions in the same week
- Ignoring weekly bias for "obvious" intraday setups
- Over-trading when weekly bias is unclear
- Changing bias mid-week based on emotions

> "Each week before the new trading week begins preferably on the weekend... the idea is you want to try to get a read on what you think that next weekly candle is going to do is it going to go higher or is it going to go lower. You're not trying to predict the close of the weekly candle."
