# Daily Bias

## Definition

Daily bias is your expectation of whether the daily candle is more likely to **expand higher or lower** based on technical structure and price levels.

## Key Differences

### Weekly Bias (From Episode 2)
- Determined on weekends
- Sets direction for entire week
- Used to filter intraday trades

### Daily Bias (This Concept)
- Determined based on daily chart structure
- How price is likely to expand TODAY
- Used to leverage sizing and target selection

## How to Determine Daily Bias

### Step 1: Look at Daily Structure
On the daily chart, identify:
- Recent swing highs and lows
- Where old liquidity pools are
- Whether price is in premium or discount
- Trend direction (series of higher highs/lows or lower)

### Step 2: Identify the Range
Mark:
- The highest point from recent swing
- The lowest point from recent swing
- Calculate the midpoint (equilibrium)

### Step 3: Determine Direction
Ask yourself:
- Is price more likely to expand HIGHER to an old high?
- Or expand LOWER to an old low?
- What's the technical context?

## Bias and Leverage Relationship

### Bearish Daily Bias
- You expect lower prices
- SHORT trades use **full leverage** (3.5-4.5% risk)
- LONG trades are **counter-trend** (use 1-2% risk, smaller)
- Only take shorts until daily low is taken out

### Bullish Daily Bias
- You expect higher prices
- LONG trades use **full leverage** (3.5-4.5% risk)
- SHORT trades are **counter-trend** (use 1-2% risk, smaller)
- Only take longs until daily high is taken out

### Consolidation/Unclear Bias
- Hard to read daily direction
- No clear bias = surgical strikes only
- Trade tight ranges with small risk
- Look for intraday volatility rather than directional moves

## Important Rules

**You don't need down-close candles for bearish bias:**
- You may have several up-close days while biased bearish
- Bias is about the OVERALL direction, not daily closes
- Some up days happen during downtrends (consolidation, pullbacks)

**Embrace the Gray Area:**
- You won't be right every day
- Bias is about PROBABILITY, not certainty
- Perfect bias prediction doesn't exist
- Use leverage strategy to manage inconsistency

## When Bias Becomes Unclear

If price:
- Consolidates around the 50% equilibrium level
- Creates choppy, non-directional candles
- Doesn't reach expected targets

**Action**: Switch to intraday volatility trading instead of directional bias trading

## Trading Application

1. Assess daily chart at start of day
2. Determine if you expect higher or lower
3. Adjust leverage based on bias conviction
4. Only take counter-trend trades with reduced risk
5. Exit when opposite level is hit (reversal point)
6. If unclear, use small risk and tactical entries

## Common Mistakes

- Trying to be right on EVERY trade instead of over time
- Using same leverage on counter-trend trades
- Holding bias even when price structure changes
- Giving up on bias after 1-2 losing days
- Not understanding bias is probability, not certainty
