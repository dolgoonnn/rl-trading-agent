# Three Stages of Trading Development

## Definition

ICT's framework for trader development describes three distinct stages that every trader progresses through: Yearner, Learner, and Earner. This progression cannot be rushed and requires personal responsibility at each stage.

## Key Characteristics

- **Yearner**: Someone who wants to learn trading but hasn't started or has tried and failed
- **Learner**: Actively studying and practicing the concepts through demo trading
- **Earner**: Consistently profitable trader who has mastered the concepts

## The Progression

```
YEARNER          LEARNER          EARNER
   │                │                │
   │  Study &       │  Demo &        │  Live
   │  Mindset       │  Practice      │  Trading
   │                │                │
   └───────────────►└───────────────►│
        Time &           Time &
     Submission       Consistency
```

## Trading Application

1. Accept your current stage honestly - most begin as yearners
2. Do not skip stages or rush the process
3. Demo trading is essential before live trading
4. Consistency over a week matters more than daily perfection
5. Personal responsibility determines your progression speed

## Trading Rules

- Never trade live funds until consistently profitable in demo
- Do not expect 100% accuracy - even ICT doesn't trade perfectly
- Study during market hours when possible, but review recordings if not
- Complete all suggested drills and homework
- Do not create dependency on someone else calling trades for you

## Common Mistakes

- Rushing to live trading before achieving demo consistency
- Expecting perfection instead of consistency
- Creating codependency on educators for trade calls
- Skipping foundational concepts for "advanced" material
- Over-leveraging or over-trading when first profitable
