# Personal Responsibility in Trading

## Definition

Personal responsibility in trading means owning both your successes and failures. No educator, system, or method can guarantee results - the outcome depends entirely on how you apply what you learn and the discipline you maintain.

## Key Characteristics

- Success and failure are both yours to own
- No one can speed up your development
- Shortcuts will reduce your results
- Following instructions exactly as given is critical
- Independent decision-making is the goal

## Trading Application

1. If you succeed, you own it - the results are yours
2. If you fail, you own that too - don't blame the method
3. Do not expect co-signing for failures
4. Complete all suggested drills and homework
5. Do not skip steps or take shortcuts

## The Two Types of Failing Students

ICT identifies two main reasons students fail:

1. **Cannot submit to the process**: Unwilling to put in the time required for individual development
2. **Rush and act foolishly**: Do things outside the instructions provided in mentorship

## Trading Rules

- Do exactly what is instructed, not your interpretation
- Put in the time required - there are no shortcuts
- Test everything taught before trusting it
- Do not create dependency on educators
- Accept that some students simply will not succeed
