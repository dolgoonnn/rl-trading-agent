# Three Drives Pattern

## Definition

The Three Drives pattern consists of three progressively higher swing highs (or lower swing lows) that approach or test an old resistance/support level. Each swing builds accumulated buy/sell stops for the eventual liquidity hunt.

## Visual Pattern (Upside)

```
Old High
   │
   ▲ ← 3rd Drive (highest)
   │\
   │ ▲ ← 2nd Drive
   │ │\
   │ │ ▲ ← 1st Drive
   │ │ │
   └─┴─┴─ Price Action
```

## The Mechanism

### Why It Forms

1. Market tries to reach old high
2. Gets rejected, retraces
3. Tries again at slightly higher level (accumulation)
4. Gets rejected again, retraces
5. Third attempt builds massive stop concentration

### Liquidity Accumulation

Each failed drive creates more buy stops:
- Drive 1: Traders place stops above it
- Drive 2: More stops above new high
- Drive 3: Maximum stops concentrated above all drives

## Key Insight

**You don't need to see the third drive break the old high!**

The pattern completes when you see the behavior: higher high, rejection, higher high, rejection, higher high. The concentration of stops above is already built.

## Trading Application

1. Identify old high that traders focus on
2. Watch for first higher swing high below it
3. Note rejection and retrace
4. Wait for second higher swing high
5. When you see the pattern forming, the stops are building
6. Short when the break down occurs below recent swing low

## Pattern Characteristics

- Works on ALL timeframes
- More reliable when old high is "clean" (clearly tested before)
- Best when approaching major resistance
- Stop hunt usually violent (good risk/reward)

## Trading Rules

- Don't short too early (before 3rd drive is evident)
- Wait for clear higher highs before the break
- The break should be aggressive ("displacement")
- Not every three-drive leads to a break (sometimes just more consolidation)

## Common Mistakes

- Shorting on the first or second drive (too early)
- Ignoring that the third drive doesn't have to break old high
- Missing the pattern because you're looking for exact same heights
- Fighting the pattern (trying to buy because "it's at resistance")
