# Displacement

## Definition

Displacement is the obvious, energetic, aggressive move through a level versus a weak, lethargic, anemic crawl through. It signals conviction and intention in the market's direction.

## The Difference

### Weak Move (No Displacement)
- Slow creep higher or lower
- Minimal volume/energy
- Takes many candles to break through
- Often fails or reverses

### Displacement (Strong Move)
- Aggressive, violent move
- Breaks through cleanly and decisively
- Fills large pip range in few candles
- Looks "obvious" on the chart
- Creates visual impact

## Analogy

Imagine a children's swimming pool:
- **Weak move**: Gently pouring water in
- **Displacement**: An elephant falling into the pool
  - Water MUST move
  - It's unavoidable
  - Very obvious

## Recognizing Displacement

Visual clues:
- Large candle bodies (not just wicks)
- Rapid movement through level
- Gap-like behavior
- Strong price acceleration
- "Animated" appearance on chart

## Trading Application

1. When price approaches a key level (old high/low, swing point)
2. If it breaks through with DISPLACEMENT → Trade in that direction
3. If it creeps through weakly → Wait, probably will reverse
4. Look for explosive candles, not gradual ones

## Combined with Stop Hunt

1. First, look for weak attempts (inducement)
2. Then look for displaced move through in opposite direction
3. That displacement = confirmation of direction

## Trading Rules

- Weak breaks often don't hold (don't trade them)
- Displaced breaks have follow-through (trade those)
- Displacement creates fair value gaps
- After displacement, expect the move to continue

## Common Mistakes

- Trading weak, lethargic breaks
- Mistaking wicks for real body movement
- Not recognizing when move is insufficient
- Assuming any break = tradeable
