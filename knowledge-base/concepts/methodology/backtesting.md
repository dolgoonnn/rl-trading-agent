# Back Testing

## Definition

Back testing is the process of studying historical price charts, annotating setups with your own observations, and building a personal reference library of how setups look and perform. It's not just looking at old data—it's intentional pattern recognition practice.

## Key Characteristics

- Pseudo-experience: Training your brain through repetition
- Chart annotation: Adding your own markups to historical charts
- Study journal: Maintaining a reference collection of examples
- Not for prediction: Purpose is learning, not predicting markets

## What Back Testing Is NOT

- ❌ Watching charts and saying "I'm done"
- ❌ Quick scans of a few days' data
- ❌ Passive observation without annotation
- ❌ Testing every indicator or complex system
- ❌ Validating whether setups "work"

## What Back Testing IS

- ✓ Deliberate study of how patterns form
- ✓ Annotating your observations on the chart
- ✓ Building a collection of examples with notes
- ✓ Training pattern recognition through repetition
- ✓ Understanding what you're actually looking for

## The Process

### Step 1: Select Time Period
- Choose a specific day or week
- Use your target timeframes (15-min, 2-min, 1-min)
- Go back as far as data allows

### Step 2: Annotate the Chart
Markup what you observe:
- Swing highs and lows
- Liquidity pools (buy stops, sell stops)
- Market structure breaks
- Order blocks and their opening prices
- Fair Value Gaps
- Entry points

### Step 3: Log Your Examples
Keep a study journal with:
- Screenshots of annotated charts
- Notes on how many pips/handles the move produced
- How long the move lasted
- Where price went first (inducement direction)
- Where the actual move went

### Step 4: Review and Reflect
- Look for patterns across many examples
- Notice what repeats
- Build confidence in the methodology
- Identify common features

## Expected Timeline

- **New students**: 30-60 days of consistent back testing
- **Frequency**: Daily annotation and review
- **Volume**: Hundreds of examples builds pattern recognition
- **Duration**: Weekly/monthly study habits needed

## Benefits of Back Testing

1. **Builds Confidence**: You see setups work repeatedly
2. **Trains Brain**: Pattern recognition improves
3. **Creates Reference Library**: Future trading clarified
4. **Reveals Personal Blindspots**: Helps identify your weaknesses
5. **Speeds Learning**: Months of pseudo-experience

## Trading Application

1. Commit to 30-60 days of consistent annotation
2. Target the 8:30-11:00 AM NY session first
3. Annotate 5-10 days per week minimum
4. Keep detailed notes on each annotated chart
5. Review your journal when confused or uncertain
6. Notice patterns that repeat across months

## Common Mistakes

- **Insufficient volume**: Only studying a few days
- **Passive viewing**: Looking without annotating
- **No notes**: Marking charts but not explaining them
- **Inconsistency**: Sporadic study instead of daily habit
- **Wrong expectations**: Thinking it proves setups work (it doesn't)

## The Metaphor

Back testing is like learning to track deer:
1. You don't know what a deer track looks like initially
2. Someone shows you what it looks like
3. You go into the woods and see many tracks
4. Over time, you recognize tracks instantly
5. You understand deer behavior through pattern observation
