# Target Refinement

## Definition

Target refinement is the skill of progressively taking profits at multiple levels, starting with low-hanging fruit and allowing winners to run if conditions permit.

## The Strategy

### Level 1: Easiest Target
Take initial profit at the most obvious/closest target. This guarantees you've locked in a win.

### Level 2: Extended Target
If price continues, hold for a second target (usually 50% level or next liquidity)

### Level 3: Full Range
Allow for the full measured move if momentum continues

## Why Progressive Targeting?

- Locks in profits early (reduces risk)
- Allows you to hold winners (captures larger moves)
- Removes emotional pressure
- Creates repeatable process

## Trading Application

1. Identify your primary target (low-hanging fruit)
2. Take 50% off at first target
3. Move stop to breakeven on remainder
4. Let second 50% run toward extended target
5. Exit based on price action, not greed

## Common Mistakes

- Holding for "perfect" targets and missing the move
- Giving back profits on retracements
- Taking all profits too early (missing big runners)
- No plan before entering
