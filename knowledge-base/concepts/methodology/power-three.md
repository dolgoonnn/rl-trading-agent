# Power Three - Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution

## Definition

Power Three is a three-phase daily price cycle:
1. **Accumulation**: Smart money entering positions
2. **Manipulation**: Fake move to shake out retail
3. **Distribution**: Smart money exiting at favorable prices

## The Three Phases

### Phase 1: Accumulation

**Bearish Day:**
- Open near the high
- Range from open to that high = accumulation zone
- Smart money selling short in this range

**Bullish Day:**
- Open near the low
- Range from open to that low = accumulation zone
- Smart money buying in this range

### Phase 2: Manipulation (The Judas Swing)

**Bearish Day:**
- Market rallies UP from opening
- Looks like it's going higher
- Gets retail traders excited about a breakout
- Then CRASHES (the manipulation)

**Bullish Day:**
- Market sells OFF from opening
- Looks like it's going lower
- Gets retail traders scared about a breakdown
- Then RALLIES (the manipulation)

**Why?** To stop out retail traders on the wrong side and provide liquidity for smart money.

### Phase 3: Distribution

**Bearish Day:**
- After the crash, market closes near the low
- Smart money is distributing their short positions
- Range from low to close = distribution zone

**Bullish Day:**
- After the rally, market closes near the high
- Smart money is distributing their long positions
- Range from low to close = distribution zone

## Opening Range Concept

**Critical Tool:**

For bearish days:
- Opening price to high = "Opening Range"
- Project this range BELOW opening = risk zone
- Stops likely below this projection

For bullish days:
- Opening price to low = "Opening Range"
- Project this range ABOVE opening = target zone
- Stops likely above this projection

## How to Identify Power Three

### Daily Chart Signs

**Bearish Power Three:**
- Open high → Rally higher → Sell off → Close low
- Multiple down-close candles in sequence
- NOT every candle closes down (but majority does)

**Bullish Power Three:**
- Open low → Sell off → Rally higher → Close high
- Multiple up-close candles in sequence
- NOT every candle closes up (but majority does)

## Why It Works

Smart money has a process:
1. **Accumulate** where retail won't (quietly at opening)
2. **Manipulate** to scare retail out (fake move opposite)
3. **Distribute** to exit after real move (closing)

This isn't conspiracy—it's efficient market function.

## Intraday Application

Once you identify daily Power Three bias:

**Bearish:**
- Look for entries ABOVE opening (accumulation zone)
- Short the fake rally (manipulation)
- Target the lows (distribution)

**Bullish:**
- Look for entries BELOW opening (accumulation zone)
- Long the fake selloff (manipulation)
- Target the highs (distribution)

## Examples from Markets

**Monday/Tuesday Pattern:**
- Indecisive candles show consolidation
- Next day: Power Three forms clearly
- Entry in accumulation zone
- Target in distribution zone

## Trading Rules

- Need daily bias first (see [[daily-bias]])
- Power Three is CONFIRMATION, not signal alone
- Requires fair value gap or order block for entry
- Don't force trades outside kill zone hours
- Accept that some days won't show clear Power Three

## Common Mistakes

- Thinking every day follows Power Three exactly
- Not recognizing consolidation days (no clear pattern)
- Entering in distribution phase (too late)
- Trading without identifying daily bias first
- Confusing manipulation with reversal

> "Power three which is accumulation manipulation and distribution... if I'm bullish I'm expecting the opening price to be near the low of the day or the session then it trades lower making some important low and then rallies creates a high and then closes near the high of the day."

> "Opening range... the range from the opening price up to that high that range is what you project below the opening price that is your opening range."
