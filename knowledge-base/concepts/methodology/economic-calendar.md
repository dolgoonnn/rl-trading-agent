# Economic Calendar and News Events

## Definition

An Economic Calendar is a schedule of economic data releases (employment, GDP, inflation, etc.) that trigger volatility and price movements in markets.

## Why It Matters

**Without knowing the calendar:**
- You might trade unannounced events
- Sudden volatility surprises you
- Stop losses get blown out
- Account gets damaged by shock moves

**With the calendar:**
- You anticipate volatility windows
- Plan position sizing accordingly
- Avoid key news releases if desired
- Or trade them if you understand them

## Finding the Calendar

**Free Resources:**
- `forexfactory.com` (Recommended)
- FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
- National economic agency websites
- Trading platforms often have calendars

## Color-Coded Impact Levels

### Impact Levels

**Red** = High Impact
- Major employment data
- Fed interest rate decisions
- GDP releases
- Major inflation data

**Orange** = Medium Impact
- Secondary employment data
- Some GDP components
- Some inflation measures
- Central bank speeches

**Yellow** = Low Impact
- Minor economic indicators
- Housing starts
- Building permits
- Consumer confidence

## Critical Time: 8:30 AM NY Local Time

**News Embargo Lift:**
- Many economic reports release at 8:30 AM NY time
- This is why 8:30 is the START of your daily analysis
- That's why ICT uses "8:30 crosshairs"

## How News Events Impact Price

### Before Release
- Anticipation builds
- Consolidation often forms
- Price may build up/down before news

### During Release
- Sudden spike or crash
- May look like false break
- Could be the real move starting

### After Release
- Price settles into new direction
- Setup may form after volatility settles
- Real move often starts AFTER news excitement

## Strategies Around News

### Conservative Approach
- Don't trade during red/orange events
- Wait 5-10 minutes after release
- Let volatility settle first
- Then enter when pattern forms

### Aggressive Approach
- Know what outcome is expected
- Trade the actual result vs expectation
- Place stops wider to allow for volatility
- Requires experience and tight risk management

### ICT's Approach
- Knows economic calendar
- Doesn't avoid news, uses it
- Understands it may be smokescreen or catalyst
- Trades the underlying structure (Power Three, etc.)

## Trading Rules Around News

1. **Know the calendar for your trading days**
2. **Note red and orange events**
3. **Wider stops for high-impact events**
4. **Consider smaller position sizes**
5. **Avoid trading THROUGH news if you're new**
6. **Wait for consolidation AFTER news**
7. **Look for Power Three pattern after event**

## Examples

### Expected Strong Number
- Market rallies before news
- Stronger-than-expected result
- Market rallies MORE (momentum continues)

### Expected Weak Number
- Market rallies before news (anticipation)
- Weaker-than-expected result
- Market CRASHES (reversal on surprise)

## Common Mistakes

- Not checking calendar before trading
- Using same stops for high-impact events
- Thinking news changes your methodology
- Over-trading during volatile news events
- Assuming news ALWAYS moves markets (sometimes it doesn't)
