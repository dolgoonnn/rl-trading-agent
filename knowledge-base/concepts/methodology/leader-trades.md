# Leader Trades and Intel Gathering

## Definition

A **Leader Trade** is a small, deliberate position placed in the market to gather information about price action and directional intention, rather than to capture a large move.

Also called: "Testing the waters," "Throwing in a contract," or "Getting a feel for the market."

## The Concept

A leader trade is NOT:
- ❌ A careless guess
- ❌ Random entry without thought
- ❌ Overtrading to make money

A leader trade IS:
- ✓ Intentional information gathering
- ✓ Small size (1 contract minimum)
- ✓ Quick feedback on market intention
- ✓ "Paying for intel"

## Why Leader Trades Exist

### The Demo Account Problem

**Demo Trading** lacks emotional feedback:
- You can place a trade and not care
- No real money = no real attention
- You don't get the "gut feel" of how price is delivering

**Live Trading with 1 Contract** provides:
- Real skin in the game
- Heightened awareness of price
- Immediate feedback on market intention
- You watch closer because money is at risk

## How Leader Trades Work

### The Process

1. **Place small position** (1 micro or 1 mini contract)
2. **Watch price reaction** around your entry
3. **Observe without trading the P&L**:
   - Does price move away easily?
   - Does it move lethargically?
   - Does it immediately run against you?
4. **Get feedback** on what the market is doing
5. **Close the position** (often at small loss)
6. **Use intel** for next real trade

### The Feedback Loop

```
Place Leader Trade
        ↓
Watch how price reacts
        ↓
Easy move away = Bias is good
Lethargic move away = Consolidation/confusion
Strong move against = Bias is wrong
        ↓
Decide on real directional trade
```

## Treating Leader Trades as Intel Premium

**Key Insight**: Small losses on leader trades = **Premium paid for information**

If you lose $750 on a 1-contract leader trade but then make $2,345 on the real trade with proper direction, you've:
- Paid $750 for certainty
- Made $2,345 on high-confidence trade
- Net profit: $1,595 (still excellent)

## Trading Application

1. At market open or unclear times, place 1-contract test
2. Don't concern yourself with the loss
3. Observe how price reacts to your order
4. Use this feedback to confirm or deny bias
5. Close quickly (minutes)
6. Place real trade with proper direction and full leverage
7. Document that the small loss "funded" the bigger win

## Position Sizing for Leaders

- **Micro contracts**: $2 per handle (good for learning)
- **Mini contracts**: $20 per handle (what ICT shows)
- **Full contracts**: $100+ per handle (eventual goal)

With this sizing, losing 750 ticks on a leader is acceptable R&D cost.

## Psychological Requirements

**You must be comfortable with:**
- Taking a loss for information
- Not treating leader trades as failures
- Separating "testing" from "trading"
- Seeing intel premium as valuable, not as weakness

## Common Mistakes

- Not closing leader trades quickly
- Averaging into leader positions
- Treating leader trades as real profit opportunities
- Not using the intel gathered
- Getting frustrated with small losses
- Comparing leader trade performance separately from real trades

## Historical Context

**ICT references George Ange**l (legendary floor trader):
- Floor traders would throw in 1 contract
- See what happens
- Get immediate market feedback
- This was standard practice among professionals

This IS professional trading methodology, not a flaw.
