# Narrative-Based Trading

## Definition

Narrative-based trading means understanding **the "why" and "story" behind price movements**, not just following patterns mechanically.

Rather than: "I see a pattern, so I trade it"

Instead: "I understand WHY this pattern is forming and what it means"

## The Problem with Pattern-Only Trading

Many traders learn:
- "Three drives pattern = reversal coming"
- "Break above high = buy"
- "FVG forms = entry point"

**But they don't know WHY these patterns work.**

Result: They get confused when patterns don't work (which is often).

## The Narrative Framework

### Elements of a Trading Narrative

**What happened before?**
- Was daily chart bullish or bearish?
- Where are old highs/lows?
- Is price in premium or discount?

**What is happening now?**
- Is there a consolidation?
- Are there clear swing highs/lows?
- How is price moving around key levels?

**What is likely to happen next?**
- Why would smart money act now?
- Where is retail liquidity likely?
- What level creates the most efficient move?

## Smart Money Narrative

**The underlying story in every move:**

1. Smart money sees retail traders are wrong
2. Smart money identifies where retail stops are
3. Smart money runs those stops first (wrong direction)
4. This creates a "stop hunt" setup
5. Retail gets shaken out or stopped out
6. Smart money moves price in intended direction
7. Price "efficiently" reaches the big liquidity pools

## Example: Bearish Narrative

```
Daily Chart: Bearish bias (price in upper range)
             Expectation: Lower prices coming

Intraday: Market consolidates, then rallies above resistance
          (looks bullish on intraday)

Smart Money Narrative:
├─ Retail thinks: "Breakout! Buying strength!"
├─ Retail places: Buy stops above this level
├─ Smart Money thinks: "Stop hunt setup!"
├─ Smart Money acts: Rally into buy stops, then crash
└─ Price then goes: Down to old lows (where it wanted to go)

Entry: Buy the FVG during the crash (counter to intraday)
Target: Old lows
```

## How to Apply Narrative

### Before Every Trade, Ask:

1. **"What's the larger context?"**
   - Daily chart bias?
   - Where's the range?
   - Premium or discount?

2. **"Why would price do this now?"**
   - What liquidity exists ahead?
   - Where are retail stops likely?
   - What's the smart money objective?

3. **"Does this make sense in context?"**
   - Does setup align with daily bias?
   - Are there liquidity pools to target?
   - Or am I just pattern-chasing?

## Narrative vs Pattern Analysis

### Pattern Analysis
❌ "I see three drives up = sell"
❌ "Break above high = buy"
❌ If pattern fails = confusion

### Narrative Analysis
✓ "Price is building liquidity with three drives"
✓ "This liquidity will be hunted when it breaks"
✓ "I'm trading AGAINST the initial move direction"
✓ Patterns are just expressions of this narrative

## Why It Matters

**From ICT:**
> "There has to be some greater context behind it and that's what I gave you in the beginning of the video... it's not enough to see how a low is taken out and expect to go higher or a high taken out and expect to go low."

Without narrative, you're just pattern-chasing. With narrative, every setup makes sense.

## Common Mistakes

- Trading patterns without understanding why they work
- Ignoring daily context and just trading intraday patterns
- Not questioning "why is price doing this?"
- Expecting patterns to work every time regardless of context
- Confusing divergence as standalone signal (missing the narrative)
