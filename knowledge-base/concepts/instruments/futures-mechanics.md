# Futures Contract Mechanics

## Definition

Understanding how futures contracts are symbolized, when they expire, and which month to trade for optimal liquidity.

## Contract Symbols

### E-Mini Contracts
- **ES**: E-mini S&P 500
- **NQ**: E-mini NASDAQ-100
- **YM**: E-mini Dow Jones

### Symbol Format: ESXXX

- **ES** = E-mini S&P
- **X** = Delivery Month Code
- **XX** = Year (22 = 2022)

## Delivery Months

Index futures trade only 4 months per year:

- **H** = March
- **M** = June
- **U** = September
- **Z** = December

Example: **ESZ22** = E-mini S&P, December delivery, 2022

## Expiration and Contract Rolling

### Expiration Date
Third Friday of delivery month

### When to Switch Contracts
- One week before expiration
- Switch to the contract with larger **Open Interest**
- Open Interest = Total contracts held (liquidity measure)

### Why Open Interest Matters
- Higher OI = More liquidity
- Better order fills
- Tighter spreads
- Easier to enter/exit

## How to Check Open Interest

1. Visit **barchart.com**
2. Go to Commodity Futures section
3. Select the contract (S&P 500 E-mini)
4. View each month's open interest
5. Trade the highest open interest contract

## Trading Rules

- Always trade the front month (or next month if rolling)
- Check open interest weekly if near expiration
- Switch before expiration (don't fight last-day volatility)
- Track expiration dates: 3rd Friday of H/M/U/Z months
