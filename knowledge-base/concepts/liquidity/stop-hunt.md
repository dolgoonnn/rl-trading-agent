# Stop Hunt and Inducement

## Definition

A stop hunt is when price deliberately moves to trigger stop losses at obvious levels before reversing in the intended direction. Inducement is the process of "engineering" liquidity by creating patterns that encourage traders to place orders that will be hunted.

## Key Characteristics

- Occurs before significant price moves
- Targets obvious stop loss locations
- Provides liquidity for smart money entries
- Creates the "wrong-side" traders who fuel the move

## The Mechanism

### Why Stop Hunts Happen

Smart money needs counterparties:
- To **sell**, they need buyers → run buy stops above highs
- To **buy**, they need sellers → run sell stops below lows

### The Sequence

```
1. CONSOLIDATION
   ┌─────────────────┐
   │  Equal Highs    │ ← Buy stops accumulate here
   │ ═══════════════ │
   │                 │
   │                 │
   │ ═══════════════ │
   │  Equal Lows     │ ← Sell stops accumulate here
   └─────────────────┘

2. INDUCEMENT (fake breakout)
   Market breaks one direction first
   to trap traders on wrong side

3. STOP HUNT (the real move)
   Market reverses and takes the
   liquidity on the opposite side

4. EXPANSION
   Now with liquidity taken,
   price moves in true direction
```

## Real Example from Episode 2

Before the bearish move:
1. Market consolidated with equal highs
2. First dropped below lows (inducing shorts)
3. Then ran above the equal highs (stop hunt)
4. Shorts got stopped out → provided liquidity to sell
5. Market then dropped significantly

## Trading Application

1. Identify consolidation with clear highs/lows
2. Note which direction has more "obvious" stops
3. Expect the opposite direction move FIRST (inducement)
4. Then expect the stop hunt on the "real" side
5. AFTER stop hunt, look for MSB and FVG entry

## Trading Rules

- Do NOT enter on the initial breakout (likely inducement)
- Wait for liquidity to be swept before entering
- The stop hunt IS your setup confirmation
- Enter after the hunt, not during it
- Relative equal highs/lows are prime targets

## The Pattern to Expect

**For Bearish Moves:**
1. Market drops first (inducing shorts)
2. Market rallies above recent highs (hunting buy stops)
3. THEN look for short entries

**For Bullish Moves:**
1. Market rallies first (inducing longs)
2. Market drops below recent lows (hunting sell stops)
3. THEN look for long entries

## Common Mistakes

- Placing stops at obvious levels (you become the liquidity)
- Entering on breakouts without waiting for the hunt
- Fighting the stop hunt move
- Not recognizing when liquidity has been taken

> "This is inducing shorts okay so it Engineers liquidity even if the idea is that they want to take the market down to this level if it's been consolidating I like to see them do this type of move here where it drops down first it's kind of like a sucker play."

> "Anytime a significant price move lower is expected always anticipate some measure of a stop hunt on buy stops or a short-term High being taken out obviously it's reversed when you're looking for higher prices."

> "Those buy stops are the counterparty or the other side of a smart money Trader that's wanting to go short because they're going to sell short they got to sell it to somebody wants to buy it at a high price that's why the market does this."
