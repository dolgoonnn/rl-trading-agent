# Liquidity

## Definition

Liquidity refers to resting orders in the market - specifically stop losses and pending orders that exist above old highs (buy stops) and below old lows (sell stops). Price is drawn to these liquidity pools like a magnet.

## Key Characteristics

- **Buy Stops**: Rest above old highs, swing highs, and equal highs
- **Sell Stops**: Rest below old lows, swing lows, and equal lows
- Price is "drawn" to liquidity pools
- Large institutions need liquidity to fill their orders
- Retail traders unknowingly provide this liquidity

## Types of Liquidity

### Buy Side Liquidity (BSL)
- Located above old highs
- Contains: stop losses from shorts, buy stop entries from breakout traders
- Targeted when smart money wants to sell

### Sell Side Liquidity (SSL)
- Located below old lows
- Contains: stop losses from longs, sell stop entries from breakdown traders
- Targeted when smart money wants to buy

## The Liquidity Draw

Price gravitates toward one of two things:
1. **Liquidity pools** (stop losses above/below key levels)
2. **Imbalances** (Fair Value Gaps that need to be filled)

## Trading Application

1. Identify where liquidity rests on the daily chart (old highs/lows)
2. Expect price to be "drawn" to these levels
3. Watch for liquidity sweeps before major moves
4. Use liquidity pools as targets for your trades

## Trading Rules

- Majority of analysis should be on the daily chart for liquidity levels
- Swing highs and swing lows are primary liquidity targets
- Equal highs/lows are stronger liquidity pools (more stops clustered)
- After liquidity is taken, expect a reversal or continuation to next pool

## Common Mistakes

- Placing stops at obvious levels (right above/below recent highs/lows)
- Not recognizing when liquidity has been swept
- Fighting price as it draws to liquidity
- Ignoring higher timeframe liquidity pools

> "Underneath those lows there's going to be sell stops... that's liquidity. When I say learn to start looking for where the Market's going to draw to it's drawing to one of two things: it's drawing to stops which is liquidity or it's running to an imbalance."
