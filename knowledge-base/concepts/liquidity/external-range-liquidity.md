# External Range Liquidity

## Definition

External Range Liquidity refers to buy/sell stops that rest **outside the current trading range**, at old highs and lows that are more distant from current price action.

- **External** = Outside the current range
- **Liquidity** = Where stops cluster
- Often the final targets for intraday moves

## Contrast: Internal vs External

### Internal Range Liquidity
- Swing highs/lows **within** the current range
- Closer, easier targets
- First profit-taking level

### External Range Liquidity
- Old highs/lows **outside** current range
- Further away
- Second/final targets
- Below equilibrium (50%) for shorts, above for longs

## Structure

### Bearish Trade Example
```
OLD LOW (far away)
   │
   └─ EXTERNAL RANGE LIQUIDITY
      (where sellers expect to buy back)
   │
50% EQUILIBRIUM (midpoint of range)
   │
INTERNAL RANGE LIQUIDITY (FVG, recent swings)
   │
ENTRY POINT (fair value gap)
   │
FIRST TARGET (internal, 50% level)
   │
SECOND TARGET (external old lows)
```

## How to Use Them

### For Shorts
1. Enter in Fair Value Gap (internal)
2. Take first partial at 50% level (internal range liquidity)
3. Take second partial at old lows (external range liquidity)
4. Hold remainder for full range fill

### For Longs
1. Enter in Fair Value Gap (internal)
2. Take first partial at 50% level (internal range liquidity)
3. Take second partial at old highs (external range liquidity)
4. Hold remainder for full range fill

## Key Insight

**Most traders miss external range liquidity because they:**
- Exit too early at first target
- Don't look far enough back
- Don't understand there are multiple liquidity pools

## Trading Application

1. Identify the major range (daily high to low)
2. Mark 50% equilibrium
3. Mark all old highs/lows beyond current range
4. Plan entry at internal FVG
5. First profit-taking at 50% (or internal liquidity)
6. Second profit-taking at external liquidity
7. Consider holding partial to outer targets

## Trading Rules

- External liquidity = further away = larger moves
- Don't force it if price gets there easily
- Use partials to lock in profits at each level
- If price reaches external level, don't be greedy
- More time to fill = less likely to be hunted

## Common Mistakes

- Exiting at first target when external liquidity is available
- Not looking far enough back for old highs/lows
- Confusing internal and external ranges
- Over-holding when external target is reached
