  "fullText": "all right folks how you doing hope everybody's doing well and this is just a kind of like a prep to get your mindset correct on what's coming in two days and on the youtube channel i want you to understand going forward that obviously you are familiar with my moniker i've dubbed myself the demo baller and i've always talked through the medium of a demo account for my own protection and i've had students come in to my fold and question whether or not it was something that could work in live accounts because they themselves couldn't make it work in either a demo or paper trading because either they could not find it in themselves to submit to the process and the time required for their own individual development or they rushed and did things foolishly outside of the instructions that i provide in mentoring so there's a small faction of individuals on the internet that believe that these things that i teach don't work in a live account and it's never really been an interest in me really to see people fall over me and believe everything i say i've challenged everyone to put the things i teach to test see if the things i'm teaching you are in fact in the marketplace do they deliver more times than that does it provide you a way of finding consistency over a week not every single day perfection because i can't provide that i don't even trade perfectly like that a new trader can new teacher can provide 100 accuracy but the way i teach and the way you'll see me mentoring on this channel in two days is i take the earners okay all of you that are not trading yet or have tried trading and failed you're yearning to learn how to do this okay so i'm teaching with that mindset now some of you obviously may have already been with me and found some consistency and some of you are doing exceedingly well and that's amazing that's great and i'm thankful for all of that but this is really meant for specifically it's for my daughter okay so i sat down and figured i'd kill two birds at one stone and if i can show a simplistic way of going in using the things that i teach stripping it down to its chrome okay no bells and whistles no advanced theories or anything like that what can i do to provide a model that my daughter could look at and say okay there's not a lot of moving parts it's real simple for me to decide what it is i want to do and also when not to do something okay and some of you may already be completely upset with that idea because you want me to come out here and lay an arsenal in your hands of high-tech weaponry it's been my experience that the highest form of analysis concepts that i've been teaching in my own personal mentorship many times creates exceptional traders yes but the majority of them in them being my students they get bogged down in all of the content and it just creates analysis paralysis and it's just too many things for them to decide because like kid in the candy store you know what do you eat first and while you're still chewing on the first thing what are you going to reach for next okay so if you don't have discipline and this is a personal responsibility characteristic that all of you gonna have to really assume okay because i can lay the things in your hands but if you don't respect the fact that they have sharp edges okay or if you use live ammunition before you're really properly trained you could hurt yourself okay so with that idea in mind um i'll be teaching a stripped down version of my concepts in a mentorship style so that way you can go through the process of learning how to do a specific trading model and i'll keep things germane to that model not trying to bring in too many things and one of the approaches is to trade it with index features okay and if you are not interested in trading futures that's fine you can still trade 4x with these concepts as well but i kind of like want to drive it with futures i actually began trading in 1992 as a commodity and futures trader and i moved away from grains and cattle and gold silver crude oil all those types of markets and moved into the bond market the 30-year treasury bond and the s p so when that became my cup of tea if you will i became a better trader intraday and i put down the pursuit of trying to be a long term position trader because i felt that that would be the best thing for me because at the time i was working a job and had to balance all those things like working class individuals need to do they have to commute back and forth to work and those types of things so i figured position trading would be the thing for me and i found out that it didn't work for me okay so i liked the idea of short-term trading intraday trading it made sense to me because i can make quick decisions that may not be your style of trading i will teach you how to apply the things i'm going to teach on the youtube channel how you can scale that up into any time frame so that way there's no excuse for you not to be able to use the information to at least better your understanding in price action okay so here's my promises to you i promise you you're going to learn things that absolutely repeat a lot you are not going to be perfect it's not my goal to make you a perfect trader it's not my goal to make you a perfect analyst my goal is to improve your understanding about price action how price is delivered and how to read the bias on an intraday basis a daily basis and hopefully over a short-term period of time you can find setups that repeat and they have common characteristics that are very similar but they won't be identical no no they won't be carbon copies but you'll see similarities that to know and trust that this is a setup that you are familiar with okay and because you were all being viewed as yearners okay you are all yearning to learn how to do this there's three stages in this youtube mentorship okay i'm treating you all as green horns okay you're just yearning to do this a lot of you that begin this youtube mentorship will not complete it because you're gonna get frustrated because you want something else or a alternative a way of me teaching it to you i'm not going to take suggestions from anybody on how to teach it differently this is the way i'm going to teach it so it's as is it will not be setups given to you for trades but i will take your attention before the fact and draw them out on a chart where i want you to study where price will likely draw to next and using the things i teach you conceptually it's your job to study that okay do not look at that as a trade setup do not look at that as a enticement to take a live trade so it's my intentions to take the yearners that want to learn how to do this through a process of becoming structured learners so you're going from yearning to learning and hopefully at your discretion and timing you'll become an earner okay so learner earner okay so those three stages are what i'm going to take you through it's not going to be an entire year mentorship i'm going to do probably three or four months but before we get into it i want you to know that i will not be providing any content to the youtube channel or my own personal mentorship during the month of march okay so march 2022 i will not be doing anything i'll be on vacation and we're gonna be doing several road trips so i will not be working for you okay so if you can accept that then i think over the next coming months it should be rather entertaining and interesting for you as a student so you're looking at this screen here and one of the things i promised i would do in 2022 is to show you how some of these concepts would work in an environment outside of a demo account i've always used the moniker demo baller because that's my name i gave myself that to kind of like champion the idea that i'm teaching through a demo but if i can teach you through a demo and things are repeating you can see your charts okay whether it's a live platform or if it's a demo you're seeing the things that i teach and if you've been fortunate enough to be in my presence when i'm calling it beforehand it's very rewarding and you all on youtube will have those experiences as well but the main thing is for you not to grow a dependency on me pointing to everything before it happens because if you do that or if you have that mindset going in it's going to stunt your growth and in fact it's going to create a barrier for you because it'll create a codependency state of mind and i don't want that i try to foster a independent mindset where you're independently coming to the decisions on your own it's that way the results are yours if it's success you own it if you failed you own that too i can't co-sign for your failure and some of you absolutely will fail i said this many times openly and every time i've been asked in 2016 i started a paid mentorship and i have students from that time period that are still trying to find their way and they cannot make these things work for themselves i have other students from 2016 that are absolutely mind-blowing results and i have students from my mentorship group that was the final class in 2021 i'm not taking new enrollment so don't ask that group i have traders that are doing very well as well so it's not a shortcoming on what it is they're being taught it's just an individual unique experience that you have to grow and go through and i can't speed it up for you any more than i already done so i'm optimistic but i'm a realist i know some of you simply will not do the things i ask you to do you will not do them effectively and you'll try to short cut certain things and you'll think that you don't need to do this and don't do that and your results will be reduced because of that so if i suggest things to you drills homework things to study do your best to participate in that okay and even if you can't do it live you know there's other ways to go through and look at it it's not the same as seeing it live but it's the best you can do because some of you have businesses some of you have school jobs okay let's be real and you may have family things that keep you also from being able to watch live data in the times i'm asking you to do it i'm not going to jump through hoops i'm not going to do acrobatics to make it you know feasible for every single one of you okay it's unrealistic for you any of you to have that expectation of me because i don't need to be doing this i love doing it i'm looking forward to doing it but i want to make sure all of you have the right mindset okay so in 2022 i promised that you would see how these concepts work in an environment outside of a demo account and what would that mean well it would mean not well not an mt4 platform because years ago it's been shown how frauds and fakes can use that platform to pretend that they're profitable that they can find setups and that their trading is amazing and they can go in and edit their trades after the fact after the market's already moved well i've already proven that i don't do those types of things and i went to tradingview and that was the platform that i asked my community so which which platform should i use if i'm going away from mt4 i want to go to a platform that's reputable so i teach and you'll see me teaching through tradingview so that's the medium that we use it's familiar to me because i'm teaching mentorship students through that but if that's not your platform of choice you're just going to have to get used to me teaching through that medium because i'm not going to do something in addition to okay but for a live account i felt that td ameritrade is very reputable and that it is regulated by the commodity futures trading commission and all of the other gardening bodies uh i cannot rig this to make it look like i'm smarter okay i can't go back in and change a trade i can't fix it okay i can't add lipstick to it okay it either is or isn't a profitable trade okay it's as simple as that td ameritrade uses the margins that are accepted and established in the industry and some of you may not be able to trade a market because of margin don't let that be a hindrance i'll show you how to work around that in other platforms while i don't personally use an mt4 account for teachings or or trading live funds or anything like that i'm confident that students that are trying to learn how to do this they can still use mt4 or mt5 or any other platform for that matter i as an educator though moved away from those platforms because they can be gained okay in other words they can be used to fraud and fake results okay so in treating you you've seen examples after examples of me going in recording an entry calling the moves as it happens without the replay button because replay doesn't let you do trade entries okay and replay only shows you a completed candlestick it doesn't show you the generation of the open all the price action up and down to the close of every individual candlestick so i've had a lot of folks over the years asked me to show live account show live account show live account and one of the things that kept me from wanting to do is because if i show results of any kind right away and this is how i viewed it too as a developing student in the 1990s that made me feel like i'm never going to get it because their results were way above what i could do as a learning developing student i had no idea what i was doing in 1992 but to see people say yeah i made fifty thousand dollars in the soybean market okay or i made eighty thousand dollars in coffee well that to me was a very huge mountain decline like i have to do that it just it felt impossible but i also didn't want to give results that were so low end that it didn't inspire an interest in having people want to learn it so because this business is extremely unique and personal it's both the easiest thing you'll ever do and sometimes for many of you is the most impossible thing to be successful at and that sounds like an oxymoron it sounds like double talk and it is but it isn't how's that for a rib you can't appreciate how difficult it is until you start treating life funds but before you start treatment life funds in your in the consistently quote unquote profitable demo trading stage you feel like you can do anything but something magical happens when you go into a live account where now suddenly every little tick means something to you because it means success or failure on an individual basis whereas if you lose in a demo account yeah you didn't really lose anything you can take another demo trade but with live account trading you have to deal with that drawdown in that loss and making money in an account is sometimes worse than losing money because it will make you feel like you want another taste of that and it creates opportunities for you to go into over trade and or over leverage and both of those things we'll talk about in the youtube mentorship how to avoid some of those things but it's up to you to avoid them okay and it takes a lot of ownership personally and the responsibility that is required to do this is paramount okay you cannot have anybody else take responsibility for your actions it's your actions and if you do well you earned it if you don't do well you hate you have to eat it okay it's the way it is and too many people are weak-minded in this world that they will never become successful traders no matter who teaches them what whatever thing they use they're gonna be a failure okay that's just the way it is and there's no way around that i can't fix and improve everyone's shortcomings i have my own personal issues that i fight and wrestle with internally and it's not easy like i'm obsessively compulsive and i have i have adv it's all these things okay that make it difficult for me and i'm bipolar so i have a lot of mental barriers but if i can sit down and frame out an idea that repeats at least once a week i'm confident that those individuals out there that are like me or without these barriers can do it as well that's my personal belief it doesn't make it fact it doesn't make it true it just means that's my belief and i've seen case studies in my own students where that's true it's a transferable skill but the skill must be honed by you the student so anyway i promised i would show some results in 2022 outside of a demo account so i used td ameritrade but years ago i was asked to show a regulated broker non-mt4 and i felt that td ameritrade was a better choice outside of you know the standard forex account brokers because with td ameritrade you can trade forex you can trade futures you can trade commodities stocks options you can bond up everything out there you can treat it okay so eventually over time if you do become successful when you're profitable you want to go with a broker that allows you to have access to all those vehicles because there's certain times of the year certain asset classes just aren't going to do very well but others will in this type of broker and i'm not repping td ameritrade i don't get anything for it i'm not an introducing broker i'm just saying that when i'm showing results in an account that is not demo this is the broker that i deposited funds with so that way we know what i'm saying here i'm not telling you to go here and trade okay i have only traded a few trades with this broker but i can tell you their fills are immediate their confirmations are solid i haven't had any problems technically it's just i'm fumbling with the layouts the way things are made available to me because it's just like anything else when i'm transitioned from mt4 teaching from that being very comfortable that going into treating view it's very cumbersome and i'm still clumsy with it when i'm teaching and i'm finding it a little bit cumbersome here as well because i just don't know where they have certain things i don't know how to make the charts scalable as faces i want them to be and like i'm used to doing it with tradestation or tradingview or mt4 so it's just a learning process but it doesn't change the fact that if you know how to trade then the trades are easy so i keep everything very simple you know i use limits and markets to get in and i just collapse a trade when it gets to a target of my choice so that's all i'm showing you here today it's just to show you that the things i'm going to be showing you are applicable on paper and in demo and the same logic is used here and while this is not a lot of money it's only twenty three thousand was it six hundred ninety four dollars and eleven cents it's not something to brag about let's just put it that way but it's something that's not demo it's something that won't stay at that level and my objective is to teach conceptually a hypothetical income based strategy okay it's not a trying to beat the world cup okay it's not trying to do better than every instagram trader out there it's just trying to teach how someone can take another opportunity and hopefully in the best case scenario and i can't guarantee or promise it to you but i'm going to certainly do my best to do what i know and how i can teach it so that way you can be at least inspired to make an attempt to try okay and because i believe that things are about to get really really hard for everyone financially and without going into great detail just look around the world and you know what i'm talking about but this is the e-mini s p march delivery contract for 2022 okay and it's a two minute chart and i want you to see the port of entry here this is a short it took and the cover was here and another one here a small little scalp and then here and then over here i'm showing you so that way you can see there was no other trades after that short or two shorts rather and then today i slept in and i just want to have something in addition to what i already have here this is kind of like one of the setups that you're going to learn in the mentorship where the entries here and exits here okay not a lot of handles okay handle would be like 45 67 to 45 68. so that's four ticks or one full handle in this market it's 50 per handle or per four ticks so every one tick is twelve dollars and fifty cents above this high is buy stops and i was targeting that here running into that okay so very very simple strategy optimal trade entry you don't need to get in at this level here okay i'm going to teach you how to have forgiving entries you don't need to be highly precise about your entries but you need to be precise about the directional bias and where it's going okay where's price reaching for and that's kind of like what i'm showing you in this mentorship on the youtube channel so if i have at least given you the opportunity to find setups conceptually if that's the case then over time if you submit yourself to it you'll find more setups than you'd ever imagine because they're there a lot in excess of these lower time frames so in a nutshell what am i saying here i'm saying that if you can learn how to take 25 handles okay if you can take 25 handles out of a market like the e-mini s p you may not have the margin 12 13 000 or whatever it is to trade one contract of this market you don't need to have that you can trade the micros and while you're not making fifty dollars per handle on e-mini s p you're making five dollars per handle you can still graduate over time and build that up and it's not a lot of initial margin that's required to do that or if you're outside the u.s you can trade a cfd and trade the u.s 500 market through like an mt4 account and again i'm just going to touch on that i'm not suggesting that you should especially those individuals in the states because it's actually illegal for you to trade that because it doesn't go through a regulated extreme exchange like a futures market would so that makes it illegal for us traders to do that so we have to in the u.s trade through the futures market and they have been nice enough to provide micro accounts for vehicles like the e-mini s p and the nasdaq they have micro accounts so whatever the multiplier would be on the regular mini it's just reduced to a smaller level in terms of margin and tick value and i'll cover all that stuff it's i've made it very very simple or at least that's been the goal i'm having going into this i'll make it very very simple for all of you to look at it say okay i don't have to have a thousand moving parts i can go in and simply look at things that make sense and if you can visually understand what it is i'm teaching you'll see that it doesn't require a lot of chart graffiti okay things that are very distracting do you look at this chart here and see a lot of things that would be mysterious no very simple little things i'll draw a line to highlight a level that i want to see breached okay and a level where i want to see it reach up into and that's the basis of understanding how the markets work within a liquidity matrix you have buy side and sell side and once you have that understanding and i'll teach some of those things in the mentorship you'll be able to find setups that repeat at least one good setup a week but if you can find 25 handles a week in the e-mini market you can do very very well with that very very well you don't need to hit home runs and here's my inspiration to you in closing if we're looking at a market that provides uh setups and let's just say your mortgage or your rent is say 1500 it may not be that much it may be actually more than that i'm just going to say let's say it's 1500 what happens if you can earn enough to make 50 or all of that a month going forward would that not be beneficial to you that's the mindset i want you all to have or let's say you have a car mode in your car payment and your car insurance if you could find a way to have that money come to you by your own speculation over time not right away i'm not suggesting all of you are going to do this in the same year but over time if you submit to the process i outlined for you my belief is my personal belief my honest opinion is i believe that it is possible now anyone can say oh anything's possible but i believe the things i'm going to show you are things that you'll be able to spot on your own now i'm going to coach you throughout the coming months showing you where certain things may deliver but i don't want you to feel like you need that so i'll teach you how to anticipate certain things on your own and then you check yourself with the things i reveal or do a review with and my belief is that you'll be better at reading price when i'm done doing this youtube internship and again i don't think i'm going to be doing more than four months and that four months is actually including the month of march where nothing nothing's getting uploaded nothing in my private mentorship or on youtube so i will be vacationing that entire month so i'll be doing those things during the month of march and then in april i'll return back to the mentor that i am in my private mentorship and i'll return back to the delivery of the lessons on the youtube channel so what does this schedule look like for this mentorship on youtube obviously friday will be your first episode and then it'll be a tuesday and thursday upload there will be assignments and pdf files provided for your learning throughout the week i'm not promising any specific schedule on that but you'll be able to see them if you go to my community tab i'll provide a way for you to get to the information and download it and i think that if you submit to this you'll be far better than you are right now about reading price expecting certain things to deliver and you'll find that it's not as challenging when you have a good mentor and you have sound logic and it's not over complicated and that's my goal going in and until talk to you on friday be safe"
