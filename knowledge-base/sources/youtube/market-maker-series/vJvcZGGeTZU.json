  "fullText": "okay folks welcome back this teachings gonna mean specifically dealing with essentials to trading the daily bias okay folks we're looking at the dollar index this is a daily chart and I want to cover some essentials and my understanding about how to trade daily bias before we begin just understand that this is not to teach you every single day Monday through Friday of every month what the daily buys is going to be tomorrow I don't have that understanding for every single pair but I do know how to find a bias across all the pairs so as a scalper I can excel by looking at using some of these concepts and obviously things that I teach in my tutorials both free and in my paid mentorship so I'm gonna cover one or two things here but I think are paramount that will help you at least try to get a hold on daily bias so if I look at a daily chart what we're trying to do is ascertain the likelihood of it being a up close or a down close day now there's absolutely no guarantee of what I'm going to tell you here being accurate so you always have to use that as a reminder because I'm human and you're human too so you're gonna make mistakes just as well as I can make a mistake and I can be wrong so I don't want you to take what I'm stating here as the panacea be-all end-all to understanding what daily biases there's a number of things that we can do to get a better opinion about what the daily bias will be tomorrow or today but it doesn't guarantee results that are going to be positive so you always have to consider that okay but it's certainly some things that you can practice in a demo account and build your understanding about daily bias in the sandbox if you will of a demo so I like to look for enemy a term and short term highs and enemy in term or short term lows and what I have here is I have this high deleted and have this low these highs up here this low slow this high and this group of lows down here okay which is just an extension of this low back here now I teach that and when the market is not in a trending model and/or a parabolic move up or down the markets going to work off of traditional support resistance theory now the problem is is which support resistance do we use so I look for the key turning points they're real obvious ones now you can use these short-term ones in here but the main one is here because the mark the market moved from that low all the way up to this high consolidated tribal I'm trying to go higher field went lower constant support here bound resistance pound support tribe one more time failure to market moved higher so we're looking at the ebb and flow of how the market moves from a point of overbought to oversold to equilibrium and consolidation and a news move that would take us to an overbought or oversold condition that's a range bound market which is where we're seeing the dollar trading right now now has a slightly bullish bias to it and has had that for a couple weeks now but for now I just want to just cover how I interpret the first thing I look for is are we coming off of a run above an old high that may see it trade back below it or are we trading below an old low that may see it trade back above it what I do is I look for these intermediate term price points and swing highs and swing lows on the daily just see if we have moved above an old high because we could very easily reject that and trade lower or if we trade below an old low we could see it come back above it and stay inside the previous determined range so if we look for candles or daily ranges that run above an old high chances are we could see it continue going higher but we also have to be mindful that we could see an eventual turnaround or reversal and it could start to go back below that old high because this could be very easily seen as a false break same way with the old lows as we see here the market does in fact trade through it tries to make a lower load couldn't do it failed again and then started to trade higher so we have to have these intermediate term swing points on our daily chart because they're going to be potential reversal points failing to follow through after breaking an old high or breaking resistance or failing to make a lower low and trend lower after breaking below old support so when the markets not trending this is the scenario that it will typically trade within which is a classic support resistance theory the problem with support resistance theory is which high in which low in which resistance in which support do you use so I start with these swing points like this or turning points where it could potentially be reversals you can see how price eventually does trade above this high here finds a measure of resistance it consolidates so we're in a point of equilibrium and the markets digesting whether or not you want to stay at these levels or trade higher or trade lower as we see the market trades below these lows in here can't rally above and collapses trades below it reprice is all the way down below an old low and then rejects comes back into an area of consolidation and rejects again expansion lower finds a low cannot find momentum through it consolidates around it tries one more time to go lower and trades higher every time the market breaks a swing high and if we look to the left of that swing hi where's the next old intermediate-term hi this one here so there's nothing for it to potentially reverse inside of until we get up to here so if we're going to use simple classic resistance and support levels we could see that this is the one we're gonna be looking for okay so if we're trading around here and we're looking here this is going to be the form of resistance so the markets want to try to get back up to that level the market does in fact try to make an attempt to do that but when we have these ideas suggesting classic support short-term resistance okay that's what this whole level is here the markets try to go through it one more time try to get through an old low and then trade it threw it back above this swing high here so what I'm going to teach you is this is what I look for for daily bias now there's a lot of folks on social media that we're looking for a weaker dollar and ignoring these types of phenomenon but I'm going to show you here you're gonna have that error as well but if we know that there is a support level here we tried several times to go below it and then we had a swing high broken what's the market really telling you it wants to go higher so what's the next level to reach for this short term resistance level okay so we can see that it wants to get to 90 417 that's the high of this candle here so what do we do at that point once we clear this high here what's the bias well if you look at this little diagram I have over here this is gonna refer to the previous day now this could be a bullish or bearish day it doesn't make a difference but when the market is bullish as we've outlined it over here we're gonna be looking for the previous day's high to be the target and the previous day's low to be supported in other words there shouldn't be any movement below the previous day's low it should all focus on the buy side that means reaching for the previous day's high when the markets bearish this scenario would be reversed we would be looking for price having an inability to get above the previous day's high and seek the previous day's low using this criteria here okay once we broke this candles swing high here bit daily bias on this candle and this candle and this is a Sunday we would look for Monday as well and then Tuesday we would look for bullishness so if we use this same theory we're going to draw this particular candle right here is the one that broke the swing high and then we know they have a resistance level it could probably reach four so we're going to be looking for the next day to trade not to the previous day's low but to and through previous stays high so this next day what's the daily bias here's the opening what's Tobias it's gonna want to reach for this hi so where is it wanting to go up so what are we going to focus on previous day's love or previous day's high create a stays high because it's bullet just wanted to go higher so the market trades up creates up close day then we take this thing thing and apply it to good need a okay so we have very simple approach there's no box in the hood up here now we have yesterday this is what this one this candles date on December 8th this candles last Thursday's tie which would be 9380 market opens we're going to see it trade through that and with the anticipation it's going to eventually try to reach for this daily high so when this happens again we don't think about the daily low from the previous day we're focusing on the movement through the previous day's high and/or eventually reaching to this level here on the daily the market closes in the middle of the range here is Sunday's trading then Monday the same phenomenon you would look for the market to want to trade through what on Monday we would look for this previous Friday's low to be supported and we would look for a price to run through previous Friday's high again this is Sunday we wouldn't expect anything there Monday we see it open here a little bit of movement above it but it does in fact pierce Friday's low and it comes back and closes where it opens so is there any significant change in the underlying direction no did we trade to this high yet no so we take that same premise now we apply it to this candle which is Monday of this particular week of the recording and we see it open here so what's the bias we're looking for the previous day's high why because we have yet to trade back to this old resistance level market opens here trades up trades through it but look what it does it comes right back inside the daily range okay in the next trading session right now at the time of this recording it's 9:26 p.m. New York time on December 12 2017 and the candle is already starting here it opened had a little bit of moving up and now we're moving little bit lower so it may want to trade a little bit higher go a little bit higher through this old high but as we're reaching for these any amount of term levels on the daily chart we're factoring in does it have enough range to reach for it above or below and then we take that approach and apply it immediately to the previous day's high and low as we have here and what you're determining is is if we're bullish we're gonna be focusing on the previous day's high for momentum and more bearish when we focus on the previous day's low for momentum very rarely do you see both sides of the previous day's candle tagged or traded through if it does it's usually indecisiveness or it's going to be a reversal soon and they're clearing the board on both sides of the marketplace and when you start seeing those types of things get prepared because the market could be in fact about the reverse you can see that actually happening here previous day's high and low here the next day it trades through it and it's low is violated too so we're about to see a reversal next day reversal ok and I'll show you another example of that see here we have it here as well we have a thursdays range now this low comes in at 94 42 and alone here is 94 42 so it's equal but still very very close to the high this is Sunday in a Monday nothing shown there but end up getting of a very important hi eventually afterwards and now this is called an outside day when you have a previous day's range that's violated with this is example it to this high is 93 98 in the low is 93 67 this candles low is 93 58 in the highest 90 99 so this is an outside day with a down close that's typically bullish reason why it creates a false break above the previous day's high and then close it on the low if we're in a bullish market overall and that occurs generally sends up a really good buy scenario I've learned that from Larry Williams and that's from like old school stuff but you got that context behind it can't just take a outside they was down closing this naturally this film is going to be a bullish today but you can see it does in fact give a huge opportunity be a buyer on this day and my application of outside day is when it does that it sets up a potential short-term reversal what Larry Williams brought to the table with it is it creates a short-term oversold scenario so it doesn't necessarily mean it's a reversal just means it's many times a continuation pattern according to his definitions all right and here's another scenario here outside day we have the candle here the hi comes in at ninety three twenty three and a low is 92 eighty one the very next day the high is taking out ninety three twenty four the lowest 9275 so reversal day and then we can see the market doesn't Peck alone trade higher as a result so you will always get the outside day at turning points but I'd like to look for it because it builds a lot of confidence behind it and by using these tools okay and when the market also breaks more or less a swing high of importance and we have a level that doesn't have anything else until we get to here the bull it's bullish okay it's bullish avoid this whole scenario like looking at this high to this low point feds don't looking for optimal trade entry you didn't sell off a lot stuff it's all raishin and willingness to want to go below this low multiple times and then it broke a swing high so the momentum is bullish and that's gonna reach for this now if we're doing that analysis on a daily for the dollar index and we've arrived at a bullishness for the dollar what does that translate for foreign currency in terms of daily bias it's gonna be a mirror image so if we go to the euro dollar we can see that the euro dollar has been bearish as we would reasonably expect notice that every single day the daily high is not concerned with at all it's the previous day's low it trades through it so now we have a low here what's it gonna do it's gonna want to trade to the previous day's low it trades through it so what's the next story line opens trades down below the previous day's low next day what's it gonna do it's kinda trade through not only the previous day's low but what's it really reaching for that old intermediate term low on the daily I'll give you some lipstick on the charts you can see that framing out a little bit so this love here and it's price is starting to drop down it's reaching for this level here why because it's basically the opposite of what we're seeing done here dollars reaching for this area term hi well the euro dollar is reaching for a mere term low each day we're focusing on again this phenomenon here we're focusing on for the euro because dollar is bullish we're focusing on the previous day's low and that's where it's going to be aiming for to it and through it that's how you think about it mines bearish back to the euro dollar every single trading day opens creates a small little tail power three Judas swing sell it down close reach for the previous day's low next day opens false rally g2 swing sell it reach for the previous day's low does it next day opens rallies false rally Judas swing sell it fade it reach for the previous day's low boom handled next day open small little tail trades lower comes back off of the low okay but we're still targeting here okay we're still reaching for that next day well this is gonna be Sunday so here's a Monday trading range it opens rallies up because the short term over vault scenario comes off the highs that is a potential reversal scenario the next day same same skit we're looking for what to market to open trade below the previous day's low and then ultimately fit trades through that forget Sunday go to Friday it trades through Friday's range and then ultimately reach for this low here so we're looking for that scenario here potentially to trade through this low still is there and so the daily bias today on December 12 2017 should be a move lower below this low using what I'm teaching you here okay so hopefully this has been insightful to you guys it gives you a little bit more framework to work with in obviously there's so many things that we can build on to build bias and inter market relationships as well but I try to incorporate the application of the dollar index analysis and also to justify what we would view in terms of foreign currencies bullish or bearish news as well and using daily bias okay folks hopefully you enjoyed this presentation if you like this presentation you want to find more you can visit my website at B inner circle trader.com",

      "text": "okay folks we're looking at the dollar index this is a daily chart and I want to cover some essentials and my understanding about how to trade daily bias before we begin just understand that this is not to teach you every single day Monday through Friday of every month what the daily buys is going to be tomorrow I don't have that understanding for every single pair but I do know how to find a bias across all the pairs so as a scalper I can excel by looking at using some of these concepts and obviously things that I teach in my tutorials both free and in my paid mentorship so I'm gonna cover one or two things here but I think are paramount that will help you at least try to get a hold on daily bias so if I look at a daily chart what we're trying to do is ascertain the likelihood of it being a up close or a down close day now there's absolutely no guarantee of what I'm going to tell you here being accurate so you always have to use that as a reminder because I'm human and you're human too so you're gonna make mistakes just as well as I can make a mistake and I can be wrong so I don't want you to take what I'm stating here as the panacea be-all end-all to understanding what daily biases there's a number of things that we can do to get a better opinion about what the daily bias will be tomorrow or today but it doesn't guarantee results that are going to be positive so you always have to consider that okay but it's certainly some things that you can practice in a demo account and build your understanding about daily bias in the sandbox if you will of a demo so I like to look for enemy a term and short term highs and enemy in term or short term lows and what I have here is I have this high deleted and have this low these highs up here this low slow this high and this group of lows down here okay which is just an extension of this low back here now I teach that and when the market is not in a trending model and/or a parabolic move up or down the markets going to work off of traditional support resistance theory now the problem is is which support resistance do we use so I look for the key turning points they're real obvious ones now you can use these short-term ones in here but the main one is here because the mark the market moved from that low all the way up to this high consolidated tribal I'm trying to go higher field went lower constant support here bound resistance pound support tribe one more time failure to market moved higher so we're looking at the ebb and flow of how the market moves from a point of overbought to oversold to equilibrium and consolidation and a news move that would take us to an overbought or oversold condition that's a range bound market which is where we're seeing the dollar trading right now now has a slightly bullish bias to it and has had that for a couple weeks now but for now I just want to just cover how I interpret the first thing I look for is are we coming off of a run above an old high that may see it trade back below it or are we trading below an old low that may see it trade back above it what I do is I look for these intermediate term price points and swing highs and swing lows on the daily just see if we have moved above an old high because we could very easily reject that and trade lower or if we trade below an old low we could see it come back above it and stay inside the previous determined range so if we look for candles or daily ranges that run above an old high chances are we could see it continue going higher but we also have to be mindful that we could see an eventual turnaround or reversal and it could start to go back below that old high because this could be very easily seen as a false break same way with the old lows as we see here the market does in fact trade through it tries to make a lower load couldn't do it failed again and then started to trade higher so we have to have these intermediate term swing points on our daily chart because they're going to be potential reversal points failing to follow through after breaking an old high or breaking resistance or failing to make a lower low and trend lower after breaking below old support so when the markets not trending this is the scenario that it will typically trade within which is a classic support resistance theory the problem with support resistance theory is which high in which low in which resistance in which support do you use so I start with these swing points like this or turning points where it could potentially be reversals you can see how price eventually does trade above this high here finds a measure of resistance it consolidates so we're in a point of equilibrium and the markets digesting whether or not you want to stay at these levels or trade higher or trade lower as we see the market trades below these lows in here can't rally above and collapses trades below it reprice is all the way down below an old low and then rejects comes back into an area of consolidation and rejects again expansion lower finds a low cannot find momentum through it consolidates around it tries one more time to go lower and trades higher every time the market breaks a swing high and if we look to the left of that swing hi where's the next old intermediate-term hi this one here so there's nothing for it to potentially reverse inside of until we get up to here so if we're going to use simple classic resistance and support levels we could see that this is the one we're gonna be looking for okay so if we're trading around here and we're looking here this is going to be the form of resistance so the markets want to try to get back up to that level the market does in fact try to make an attempt to do that but when we have these ideas suggesting classic support short-term resistance okay that's what this whole level is here the markets try to go through it one more time try to get through an old low and then trade it threw it back above this swing high here so what I'm going to teach you is this is what I look for for daily bias now there's a lot of folks on social media that we're looking for a weaker dollar and ignoring these types of phenomenon but I'm going to show you here you're gonna have that error as well but if we know that there is a support level here we tried several times to go below it and then we had a swing high broken what's the market really telling you it wants to go higher so what's the next level to reach for this short term resistance level okay so we can see that it wants to get to 90 417 that's the high of this candle here so what do we do at that point once we clear this high here what's the bias well if you look at this little diagram I have over here this is gonna refer to the previous day now this could be a bullish or bearish day it doesn't make a difference but when the market is bullish as we've outlined it over here we're gonna be looking for the previous day's high to be the target and the previous day's low to be supported in other words there shouldn't be any movement below the previous day's low it should all focus on the buy side that means reaching for the previous day's high when the markets bearish this scenario would be reversed we would be looking for price having an inability to get above the previous day's high and seek the previous day's low using this criteria here okay once we broke this candles swing high here bit daily bias on this candle and this candle and this is a Sunday we would look for Monday as well and then Tuesday we would look for bullishness so if we use this same theory we're going to draw this particular candle right here is the one that broke the swing high and then we know they have a resistance level it could probably reach four so we're going to be looking for the next day to trade not to the previous day's low but to and through previous stays high so this next day what's the daily bias here's the opening what's Tobias it's gonna want to reach for this hi so where is it wanting to go up so what are we going to focus on previous day's love or previous day's high create a stays high because it's bullet just wanted to go higher so the market trades up creates up close day then we take this thing thing and apply it to good need a okay so we have very simple approach there's no box in the hood up here now we have yesterday this is what this one this candles date on December 8th this candles last Thursday's tie which would be 9380 market opens we're going to see it trade through that and with the anticipation it's going to eventually try to reach for this daily high so when this happens again we don't think about the daily low from the previous day we're focusing on the movement through the previous day's high and/or eventually reaching to this level here on the daily the market closes in the middle of the range here is Sunday's trading then Monday the same phenomenon you would look for the market to want to trade through what on Monday we would look for this previous Friday's low to be supported and we would look for a price to run through previous Friday's high again this is Sunday we wouldn't expect anything there Monday we see it open here a little bit of movement above it but it does in fact pierce Friday's low and it comes back and closes where it opens so is there any significant change in the underlying direction no did we trade to this high yet no so we take that same premise",

      "text": "now we apply it to this candle which is Monday of this particular week of the recording and we see it open here so what's the bias we're looking for the previous day's high why because we have yet to trade back to this old resistance level market opens here trades up trades through it but look what it does it comes right back inside the daily range okay in the next trading session right now at the time of this recording it's 9:26 p.m. New York time on December 12 2017 and the candle is already starting here it opened had a little bit of moving up and now we're moving little bit lower so it may want to trade a little bit higher go a little bit higher through this old high but as we're reaching for these any amount of term levels on the daily chart we're factoring in does it have enough range to reach for it above or below and then we take that approach and apply it immediately to the previous day's high and low as we have here and what you're determining is is if we're bullish we're gonna be focusing on the previous day's high for momentum and more bearish when we focus on the previous day's low for momentum very rarely do you see both sides of the previous day's candle tagged or traded through if it does it's usually indecisiveness or it's going to be a reversal soon and they're clearing the board on both sides of the marketplace and when you start seeing those types of things get prepared because the market could be in fact about the reverse you can see that actually happening here previous day's high and low here the next day it trades through it and it's low is violated too so we're about to see a reversal next day reversal ok and I'll show you another example of that see here we have it here as well we have a thursdays range now this low comes in at 94 42 and alone here is 94 42 so it's equal but still very very close to the high this is Sunday in a Monday nothing shown there but end up getting of a very important hi eventually afterwards and now this is called an outside day when you have a previous day's range that's violated with this is example it to this high is 93 98 in the low is 93 67 this candles low is 93 58 in the highest 90 99 so this is an outside day with a down close that's typically bullish reason why it creates a false break above the previous day's high and then close it on the low if we're in a bullish market overall and that occurs generally sends up a really good buy scenario I've learned that from Larry Williams and that's from like old school stuff but you got that context behind it can't just take a outside they was down closing this naturally this film is going to be a bullish today but you can see it does in fact give a huge opportunity be a buyer on this day and my application of outside day is when it does that it sets up a potential short-term reversal what Larry Williams brought to the table with it is it creates a short-term oversold scenario so it doesn't necessarily mean it's a reversal just means it's many times a continuation pattern according to his definitions all right and here's another scenario here outside day we have the candle here the hi comes in at ninety three twenty three and a low is 92 eighty one the very next day the high is taking out ninety three twenty four the lowest 9275 so reversal day and then we can see the market doesn't Peck alone trade higher as a result so you will always get the outside day at turning points but I'd like to look for it because it builds a lot of confidence behind it and by using these tools okay and when the market also breaks more or less a swing high of importance and we have a level that doesn't have anything else until we get to here the bull it's bullish okay it's bullish avoid this whole scenario like looking at this high to this low point feds don't looking for optimal trade entry you didn't sell off a lot stuff it's all raishin and willingness to want to go below this low multiple times and then it broke a swing high so the momentum is bullish and that's gonna reach for this now if we're doing that analysis on a daily for the dollar index and we've arrived at a bullishness for the dollar what does that translate for foreign currency in terms of daily bias it's gonna be a mirror image so if we go to the euro dollar we can see that the euro dollar has been bearish as we would reasonably expect notice that every single day the daily high is not concerned with at all it's the previous day's low it trades through it so now we have a low here what's it gonna do it's gonna want to trade to the previous day's low it trades through it so what's the next story line opens trades down below the previous day's low next day what's it gonna do it's kinda trade through not only the previous day's low but what's it really reaching for that old intermediate term low on the daily I'll give you some lipstick on the charts you can see that framing out a little bit so this love here and it's price is starting to drop down it's reaching for this level here why because it's basically the opposite of what we're seeing done here dollars reaching for this area term hi well the euro dollar is reaching for a mere term low each day we're focusing on again this phenomenon here we're focusing on for the euro because dollar is bullish we're focusing on the previous day's low and that's where it's going to be aiming for to it and through it that's how you think about it mines bearish back to the euro dollar every single trading day opens creates a small little tail power three Judas swing sell it down close reach for the previous day's low next day opens false rally g2 swing sell it reach for the previous day's low does it next day opens rallies false rally Judas swing sell it fade it reach for the previous day's low boom handled next day open small little tail trades lower comes back off of the low okay but we're still targeting here okay we're still reaching for that next day well this is gonna be Sunday so here's a Monday trading range it opens rallies up because the short term over vault scenario comes off the highs that is a potential reversal scenario the next day same same skit we're looking for what to market to open trade below the previous day's low and then ultimately fit trades through that forget Sunday go to Friday it trades through Friday's range and then
