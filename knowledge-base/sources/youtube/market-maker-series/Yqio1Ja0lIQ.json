  "fullText": "- folks welcome back this teaching is going to be specifically dealing with the weekly bias excellence in short term trading okay the weekly bias and short term trading point to focus in this module we'll be mapping bullish weekly profiles when to anticipate weekly lows to form and mapping bearish weekly profiles when to anticipate weekly highs to form okay so the weekly SmartMoney view as you see here this is a chart depicting one week's worth of trading and I want you to take a look at how the market gyrates from day to day Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and Friday this would be in a bullish scenario okay this is for bullish conditions what we're looking for is the weekly low to form between Sunday's opening and Wednesday they're high odds or the weekly low to form before Wednesday's New York open or would be otherwise 7:00 a.m. New York time the odds further increase between Tuesday and Wednesday focusing on Tuesday's London to Wednesday's New York open so let's flesh out some more ideas about this what you're gonna be looking for is a higher time frame directional bias and there's a couple different ways you can do that and I teach those in the mentorship but if you'd like looking at a higher time frame charts like monthly and weekly charts they will aid you and assist you in determining that but this is a hourly and/or 30-minute time frame viewing the weekly perspective so that way you can see the entire daily range over the spectrum of the entire Sunday's open to Friday's closed what we want to be focusing on is the opening price on Sunday now some of you may not have Sunday candle in your platform and that's fine it's still beneficial for you to seek out whatever the sunday opening price is so you can use things like websites that follow the foreign exchange markets and get an opening price because sometimes these I think prices will create gaps from varieties closed those gaps are very indicative of sentiment and sometimes they could be exhaustive or they could be insightful and inform that it's showing underlying strengths if it gaps up it may not feel it may not trade back down and fill that gap entry higher it may just straight straight away you know Google North right from the higher opening on Sunday to open what we're looking for is well on Sunday's opening we want to see that opening price and extend it all the way to Friday keeping that in mind and I'll explain why that's important in a couple of minutes but we're primarily looking for is a power of three formation on the weekly range but from a 30-minute chart which is what we're showing here this is going to give us the intraday reference points and it'll show you how the market moves and gyrates with this in now if you choose not to use Sunday's data which i think is little myopic lamb or at least talking about the relationships of the opening price for the weekly range because they have to understand the debt still is there in terms of trading just because your platform may or may not have a Sunday scandal the market data in fact open many times hours before you would expect it to a fashion price when your Monday candle so it's beneficial free to go through and research and find out what you looking prices on your respective Forex pair that's what you're using you can elect to go with the opening price on Monday's trading but your data is going to be slightly skewed okay so whatever your first opening price is on Monday you can use that price and draw that across okay but if it's an instance where the market starts at a lower price level on Sunday we may not get the opportunity on Mondays opening price to dip down below it one more bullish or want to be a buyer at the opening price or below it okay so I use the Sunday's opening price to teach new traders because it teaches in number one sentiment it teaches them overbought oversold without the use of indicators okay and it also teaches you to trust a hard time frame premise what's the monthly weekly charts suggesting are they implying that we're gonna be moving higher or are we moving lower this example here is going to be framed on the basis that we elected by a way of analysis that the higher time frame charts are looking for higher prices so that means price is going to expand on the open one Sunday or shortly thereafter and having a higher close or at least expanding throughout the week to make a higher price level where we can hopefully find an opportunity to harvest some pips in terms of power three what we're seeing here is the relationship day by day and what price has done with that opening price but in terms of a weekly range if you're a short-term trader you can use this insight and not have to worry about day trading at all once you know the opening price you'll be anticipating that move down below the opening price now what level you choose to buy it down there there's lots of different ways you can do it and I teach a lot of them and it's not important for me to share with you any one particular setup because I've learned over the years teaching that some of my concepts don't always gel or more or less work for certain individuals it's not because the patterns are they're not you know favorable in terms of how to use them in the price action it's because of personality it I'll give you an example to be a buyer when the market creates a new low that is sometimes scary for certain traders and they won't want to do that other traders that see that and they say what makes perfect sense they will gravitate towards that type of pattern the ones that don't want to be buying below all lows that trader will probably do very well when they do optimal trade entry buys where it's proven it's gone up a little bit and it retraces it makes more sense for them to do that so that's why in a free content I'm avoiding that whole way of teaching because it gives the impression to the students or the first-time readers or viewers of my content that I'm trying to promote you to follow a specific mold okay or or press you into a specific mode which as a teacher and a trader I know that doesn't work you can't work okay it might work for some of you but I don't want to make my success as a mentor be based on just a handful of my students I have a way of teaching where the content is there for you to plug in play for your own personality and I do a lot of that stuff in the mentorship but for free content this is all you need to work with and you'll find all the setups you'll ever look for now we can fine-tune this principle and actually give you specific levels on what you would be buying at below the opening price both in a day traders perspective and/or a short-term trader so it's a short trend trader if you've watched my content and you've been well impressed with the ability to have that precise of an understanding you can still use these same concepts by way of using the opening price in trading the weekly candle so the weekly range or weekly candle they're synonymous terms okay but I use them in a tune interchangeably but for the sake of weekly range that's exactly what I'm talking about okay so what we're forming here is this particular week's entire data from the low of the week to the high that week this opening price is representative of the Sunday's opening price we would be already bullish on the week we would anticipate this movement from the open and down we would be interested in anything from the open to trade up first we would look at that as not interesting we would wait for it to drop down into an oversold condition what makes it oversold because its opening price is value okay that's fair value at the time of new trading at some point in the future we would anticipate the market dropping down okay that dropped down from the opening price it's going to make price in terms of what we bought or sold oversold because the context our premise behind it we would already be bullish relative to the monthly and weekly chart so if we're expecting them weekly try to continue higher the new week we would expect to see the opening price that drop down which is a Judas link this engineered move is to knock individuals are already out long or drive individuals that are not in the marketplace that want to sell short to entice them to do so any pending orders that would sell in a breakout it would be filled down on this movement here so you as a short-term trader you could elect to buy at one of these levels below the opening price that my tutorials teach some of but we go into great detail with that mentorship so you can frame all types of entry techniques and concepts they reside below the opening price okay wait Lee uses information from the free tutorial standpoint is if we know that the low of the week from the opening price on Sunday making a low of the week on this weekly range it's going to form between Sunday's opening and Wednesdays New York open the odds favor a greater chance of the low for me when you're bullish between the London set up and New York set up of Wednesday so Tuesday's on them set up to Wednesday's New York set up between these two time periods I'm going to encourage you to go through your charts it's really really easy to go through hindsight data and you'll see what I just told you is like the elephant in the room retail traders until I taught this stuff publicly on my youtube channel and in my to tour nobody was talking about this nobody was mentioning it no one was using it and the folks that tried to say they were always aware of it they showed examples in their trades and it never was there they were doing the things that were opposite to what this teaching teaches I've been doing this for two decades okay and only a few handful of individuals around the world had opportunity to learn from me you could read about 18 years ago or so and that's small little circle of individuals they and myself have the only ones have been really been aware of this type of phenomenon now since I made my tutorials there's been educators and stuff's they've linked on to what I teach any renamed it okay they call it a weekly strategy they call it you know whatever else they want to come up with and they add some kind of a twist in the title but once you see what they're doing it's what I've taught here and what I've taught in my previous teaching how to cache explosive price moves which is the free tutorial which I didn't like the presentation but if you watch that video or look at it the first couple minutes of that video is actually what I'm showing you here so once that was produced and shared on baby pips and that crowd watched it all there - they caught fire problem is is most traders they don't know what to do with it below the opening price one more bullish so which level do you buy in this instance I'm just gonna teach the classic market structure goal - optimal trade entry okay so you're gonna anticipate Tuesday to Wednesday's low forming now sometimes it's going to on on Monday but you can still get a continuation move on Tuesday or Wednesday but primarily I want you to be thinking how Tuesday to Wednesday in that time period that's when the weekly low is gonna form many times it's going to be Tuesday's long and open okay now if that's going over your head I want you to stop think about what I just told you though weekly low most likely forms on Tuesdays on an open when we're bullish if we are bullish and it does not form on Tuesday and we drop down on Wednesday Wednesday we'll probably be the low of the week if we go lower than the low formed on Wednesdays New York open you have to nix the trade and go to the sidelines on the day expecially if you took an opportunity on Tuesday or Wednesday and they were losing trades you have to stop and just submit to the fact that you're wrong even if Thursday or Friday it goes higher and that's a very hard lesson to learn because you were bullish on the week but you get stopped out and it still ends up going there and you've missed out on it that's going to happen it's happened to me many many times and it does not undo the effectiveness or the validity behind the setup there's going to be an imperfection in your trading so you have to permit that okay but if we're looking for too low the forum on Tuesday or Wednesday what we're simply looking for is a new low in the week preferably on Tuesdays on an open or Wednesdays New York Oakland okay between these two reference points should that occur okay soon as we have a lower low in a week formed we find the short term high prior to that new low forming in this case it's this here okay so when that occurs that's our trigger point so for individuals that want to buy on retracements with optimal trade entry we're going to wait for price to break above this short-term high which it does here from this point here you're going to be looking for the low the forum prior to this run-up now classic fib people will go from this low to this high sometimes that'll work sometimes it won't what I want you to look at is we have the most dynamic price movement off of this low so you're gonna anchor your fib on the lowest close or open in that swing low drag it all the way up to this body here now I don't have that in here cuz I want the two presentations to be clean because my watermark on top of the chart and my references I'm showing you here I want you to go through and look at this for yourself go through your own data it the November 21st and 22nd of 2017 use a 30-minute chart and you'll be able to see going that fib that low to this high you get an optimal trade entry beautifully lined up right there and there's your continuation by and here's the thing you're buying it below the weekly open one Sunday you're buying below that weekly open trying to do power three one week this gives us the best advantage okay to be in before the expansion that takes place on the weekly range because we're buying below evaluation that would deemed as fair and it drops down to an oversold condition so while everyone else would look at these movements dropping down here and dropping down here as momentum on the downside our perspective is like the smart money we're looking at that as it going down to an area of a really really cheap price so if you're terribly afraid just you know to step in there right when it breaks below to a new low I understand that but over time you're gonna have to you know encounter that and just move past it or just elect to go with often trade entry as your your pattern and there's certainly nothing wrong with it but if you're wanting to buy up here and you're always gonna wrestle with the idea I wish I would have bought down there this is only going to occur if you buy at new lows at a time when it should be creating the low the week in like I said it's hard to do that without just getting in here and desensitizing yourself by practicing it practicing in a demo account and doing it live with a demo over and over and over again to the point where you just don't care if the outcome is going to be profitable or not because that's what it takes to be consistent you're not worrying about the end result you just trust the process of what you're doing eventually over time the sample sizes are more weighted on the positive side of what you're expecting to see then that of the temporary and sometimes you know unwanted negative results that is missing the trade or getting stopped out so this would be the optimal trade entry again it's on a day that we would look for to form Wednesday and priced our to expand we get about above the opening price preferably we want to see price show a willingness to want to expand away from the opening price and not want to come back down to it now there are some certain caveats to this and I'll add this to you just to you'd be a little bit more splice on this if we make the low of the week on Monday how do we know that it trades back above the opening price okay one Monday and expands a little bit more okay this right here we dropped down and went back above the opening price I don't trust this because it's Monday and I like to see the Monday's range okay I want to see what the money's entire daily ranges so I don't I don't get the weekly loads many times actually Isis be fair about about 90% of the time if the week makes it slow on Monday I'm missing that because I elect to sit many times on the sidelines because I want to use the range of Monday to give me insights so on Tuesday I like to get hopefully a lower low when I'm bullish and then I'll buy in here okay based on some pattern or some kind of a key level I teach and I'll ride that out and hopefully get back above the opening price now if we trade above the opening price one say Tuesday I will permit Wednesday to see retracement back down the opening price funds and support and then rally back away on Wednesday if we're breaking above the opening price on Wednesday it cannot it should not come back to opening price now again in simple terms Wednesday is de line in the sand if it trades above the opening price one more bullish we do not permit it to come back down to the opening price it can happen if we go above the opening price on a new low on Tuesday we could still see it come back down and retest the opening price on Wednesday the algorithm will want to expand away from this opening price after Wednesday because it only has newer opens time period to Friday's closed and that's why you see this acceleration in the movement on the weekly range nealy after wednesday breaks above the opening price now you're gonna look at this and I'm gonna be criticized by folks that don't like what I'm teaching because they're you know sold one indicators or whatever else they're doing or they don't like the fact that I'm right they're going to say this is being cherry picked in hindsight capacity well grant I am hand picking this in hindsight to show you because it's already happened anyone teaching you anything is going to be some level of hindsight I'm telling you to go through your charts and you will see this yourself as many as examples that you're gonna find you're gonna see quickly what I'm telling you is the gospel okay it's just the way it is you can argue and wrestle with this but if you trade against this premise you may understand why you're losing money okay so once we get through the opening price on Wednesday and or on Tuesday or Monday Monday I personally will never get the low on Monday you know we clean low I won't get that on Monday you can try to test that theory and buy down here and you might get something like this and this could have kept on going if you're going to trade on Monday if it trades back to the opening price my opinion is is to take some profits there and leave a stop in so that way if it does not yeah it protects any open profits but leave it in there because you might have caught the tiger by the tail statistically studying all the possible scenarios and weekly protocols that I teach I elected to simply wait till Tuesday and that's just the way I do it obviously I'm not encouraging to follow me step by step but I'm doing it and telling you this because I want to be open about how I do it Tuesday I'm really actively looking at London open okay that's really what I'm looking for so between London open on Tuesday and some of these opening I'm really not doing much at all I'm just relaxing and spending family time I glanced at the charts but I'm not really trying to actively pursue anything until around 1:00 and open on Tuesday and if you look at the weekly ranges on the front currency pairs you'll see that many times we are in the bullish or bearish these turning points will form on Tuesdays on and open but for this example here we're bullish and we're looking at the opening price on Sunday you want to see it drop down it trades down to a level we wait for it to break a swing high okay this could have easily formed on Monday and the retracement could have been occurring on Tuesday like it is here on Wednesday and in Tuesday could have trades to do claim price and we could still permit it to come back down to that once a retest of the weekly open but after that it's not allowed to do it again if it ever starts to gravitate back down to that opening price after Wednesday trading through it it's probably made a reversal or it's going to consolidate for the rest of the week either one's not good for a weekly expansion now there's going to be times where we'll trade above the opening price on the weekly range and not go very far and just gravity right back to the opening price and it's going to be a quiet next week if it's still bullish the following week would still use the same criteria okay but the next stage would be really expecting that expansion here now this portion of the weekly range is going to be what you're holding for an event say until Friday's closed your mindset should be not trying to find 10 pips or give me 20 pips okay I start my week off looking for scenarios that get me in down below the opening price because I understand it below the opening price is the ideal entry point for all my day trades and my short-term trading as a short-term to swing trader you can use that insight using the weekly ranges and not require yourself to be anywhere near an hourly or four-hour chart or anything less than that so there's no reason for folks that watch my beer my my videos and I'll say well you know I'm not a day trader I can't use this information it's interesting ICT but I just I can't do that you have no excuse because of this gave you a bazooka okay this gave you the ability to go in there and short-term or sling trade using the opening price on Sunday okay wait for it to drop down and simply go in and handle it now I will toss this out there and you guys can test this theory on your own okay if at any time you are bullish on a weekly range if the opening price and we drop down say 30 pips okay if we drop 30 pips from the opening price on Sunday test this theory out if you're bullish buy 30 pips below the opening price one Sunday and use a hundred and 50 pips top this is for swing traders not short-term traders okay and let that go and see if you don't get 150 to 300 pips test that theory and give me your feedback through Twitter you try this on any pair really any kind of market really but for forex I'm gonna give you that suggestion now it does not mean that you won't see it drop down sometimes 50 to 75 pips okay but generally your stop-loss of 150 pips after buying below the opening buy 30 pips what you're really doing is you're saying I don't believe in to go down 180 pips from the opening price if it's truly bullish we won't spend a whole lot of time below the opening price and it won't go that far down below it unless we are changing long term in a reversal from a bearish market to a bullish market then we can see some really wild reaches below the opening price which I don't look for those anyway I want to be looking in a marketplace that's already in position to be moving it has been moving for a while longer term and I'm just getting in positioning myself in a logical area where the next upside is clearly an expansion or bullish up close for Friday okay the weekly smart money view or bearish conditions okay you can see here we have the same thing dis reversed we're looking for the weekly high to form between Sunday and Wednesday high odds between Wednesday's New York open 7 a.m. from Sunday's opening that's what we're looking for but the odds further increase again between Tuesdays and Wednesdays trading specifically focusing on Tuesday's long and open to Wednesday's New York open ok so we're looking at the weekly range here for this particular currency this happens to be a dollar cad and you can see how price didn't I have a up movement on Monday and then we had another movement up on Tuesday creating the high of the week during the London session or what we were looking for for the scenario overall we anticipate a bearish week ahead of the open once that opening price is derived on Sunday we extend that through the entire week until Friday's close movements above the opening price we anticipate that we want to see price go to a level that would push price into a technically overbought condition there is no overbought indicator on my chart I'm reading price action the fact that we're trading above the opening price in an market environment that's bearish longer-term that's what frames my idea over highly weak forms on Tuesday Wednesday we barely have any type of movement whatsoever we still have a little blip on the radar as price runs it back above that opening price and then quickly rejects notice that once it leaves that opening price on Wednesday it doesn't try to go back to it now it does retrace here but it's not getting close to it if it does it's going to be a mixed week we don't want to be a part of that okay and ultimately price comes down sales this old low and let me see a reversal that's outside the scope or the focus the point we're looking for is we want to be when we're bearish we're looking to sell short one or at very close to the weekly high in riding that down to some measure of expansion below the weekly opening price so in terms of the weekly range or weekly candle what we're looking at is the opening price here then we're seeing the Judas swing this is the portion of price action that we're anticipating we anticipate this type of price action and we want to have a level in mind before it starts to even trade up where we're wanting to sell short in this example a real good example would be we have a high here and a Monday's high so we have relatively equalized price stabs above this you could be a seller here and I did in fact take this trade and I shared it on Twitter you guys can see that go through my Twitter feed look at the date for around November 21st 22nd I would have shown the example and I my entry points and everything's in there so short with the expectation that there's going to be a sell-off on the dollar cad price sells off goes below the opening price now remember what I said as long as it is before Wednesday's New York open its permissible see price trade back to in this case above the opening price because on Wednesday that's when it should leave the gate once it starts leaving that opening price it's going to expand to reach for some measure of price action that creates the movement below the open price so the range expansion portion of the weekly range that's what you're holding for but you want to be positioned up here while price is going up when it's long term bearish it feels scary it feels odd it feels out of place because you're watching price shoot up like this and every retail minded trader out there and every person that's on Twitter and Facebook they're gonna be looking at this thing saying it's going to the moon and it's not it's a southbound train once this thing leaves the station which is the opening price on Wednesdays new york open draw that line on your chart once that occurs it should always try to expand away from the opening price you should have a predetermined level where you're going to be getting out at inside of this expansion okay in this case we have relatively equal lows here we have a low here we have a low here so if we go about 10 to 20 cuts below that that would give us around 26 95 and that's 26 95 right here that gives us to this price point here it goes a little bit lower but then author link comes back with a deep retracement and then closes end of the week giving us the weekly candle or range profile like the ideal scenario is to look for a cell above the opening price as a day trader you could be focusing in on that and or as a short-term trader or swing trader you can use the weekly candle or weekly range to trade entirely off of that and not even look at an intraday chart not even a daily chart you can take these types of trades and again look for that same scenario waiting for it to trade about 30 pips above the opening price okay in this case here we opened around here we can go up 10 20 30 pips so you could be a seller around 2005 and a stop loss of 150 points or pips okay and try to get 150 to 300 pips profit from them by selling at 120 805 or thereabouts price goes all the way down to a low of approximately 26 75 I gave you this example to see and show you how even using the objective of 150 pips - 300 pips you may not get that actually in your profit which is why I teach to take partial profits so if we sold short hypothetically at 120 805 or whatever 30 pips would be above that opening price if we sold there with the expectation that we're gonna try to capture a hundred fifty pips or more as soon as you made a hundred pips why wouldn't you want to bank they're seeing that we're probably only gonna make about 130 pips on this move on your pip movement anytime your moves ever traded a hundred pip intervals you have to take something off learn to do that if you do not do that I promise you you will look back and regret not having done so so as a day trader you know obviously if it moves on our pips you certainly when we banking 80% of your position and if you're a short-term trader you want to be at least half your position out because the weekly can change gears midweek for instance it could have went down to this low here and in trading on to Tuesday high those occurrences can happen so if it's offered up a hundred take something off at 100 pips regardless of what style or what type of integral up trader you are if it gives you a hundred pips pay yourself on those hundred pips even if it's one tenth of your position overall do it because it number one it'll feel good to do so it'll pay you for your time and the risk that you put in and it teaches you the value of doing overtime the folks that say that partial profits are stupid or idiotic you shouldn't do it because the full risk was what it was the beginning the risk is going to change preferably it's gonna reduce over the life of the trade anyway but that same initial risk does not guarantee full profit the assumptions that use just because you put a specific number of risk percentage on at the beginning trade and it's stupid to take partial profits because you risk this much but you don't how many times have your trades gone to full profit how many times have you failed to take something off if you just would have taken something before it turned back on you that's what I've been doing for 25 years folks okay 25 years I seen enough of this to no partial pays okay it pays you have to give yourself the ability to take something out because the market is not going to do it for you you have to take it out so if you're gonna be a short-term or swing trader you want to use that weekly range like this if we expand a hundred pips we're looking for 150 to 300 pips for the week you're not always gonna get 300 pips but preferably if we're bearish in this case we want to see hopefully a big weekly range remember this small range big range going on well if we're starting to see small weekly ranges right ahead of this and we're still bearish if we get this scenario here we can do very very well you can see those big 300 sometimes even 500 pip ranges on a weekly especially if it's gonna be a lot of news a lot of things that are happening you know economic calendar it can be extremely volatile and it creates a large range on the weekly so the model is we look for if you're a short-term swing trader that can't be in the intraday stuff you can sell short above the opening price about 30 pips now you can fancy dance that you can say well I'm gonna be a seller at 40 pips above the opening price a rockin if it trades up 50 pips above the opening price I could be a seller there okay and look for 150 pips to 300 pips again with the expectation you're not always going to get 300 pips but if it allows you to make a hundred pips when you take your first partial off and put your stop at breakeven you're in a beautiful position because if you take say hey if your position off at 100 pips could you stop at breakeven and then see if it gives you any more movement for the rest of the week once the examples come by looking at Pine site data and seeing what's available you will quickly see whether this is for you or not I'm not trying to twist your arm I'm just giving those individuals that don't have the ability to sit in here every single day watching intraday price action a way they use this information on a higher time frame you know allow them to participate now if you are able to look at the market Tuesday or Wednesday and you only have to do it on those days around Tuesday's run and open and Wednesdays London open if you watch those specific time points you can look at specific levels in price action that I teach in my tutorials and go into great detail with the mentorship you can sell at a more favorable entry point and you won't have to just say okay well here's the opening price on Sunday I'm going to take a set number of pips above the opening price all the time and sell short there when I'm bearish you can avoid that okay and you can say okay well I'd say open here okay I'm gonna watch and see what Monday does Monday's dilly-dallying around create some Monday high here and we start trading here we start to drop down ahead up one then we're not interested in that we're looking for this high in this high here double tops okay what's gonna be resting above that buy stops so if you know that going ahead of Tuesday's on an open you could just simply do a sell limit order right above the high on Friday or a high on Monday and then you can really reduce the amount of exposure you have and then still have that same 100 keep it profit objective hopefully they

      "text": "- folks welcome back this teaching is going to be specifically dealing with the weekly bias excellence in short term trading okay the weekly bias and short term trading point to focus in this module we'll be mapping bullish weekly profiles when to anticipate weekly lows to form and mapping bearish weekly profiles when to anticipate weekly highs to form okay so the weekly SmartMoney view as you see here this is a chart depicting one week's worth of trading and I want you to take a look at how the market gyrates from day to day Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and Friday this would be in a bullish scenario okay this is for bullish conditions what we're looking for is the weekly low to form between Sunday's opening and Wednesday they're high odds or the weekly low to form before Wednesday's New York open or would be otherwise 7:00 a.m. New York time the odds further increase between Tuesday and Wednesday focusing on Tuesday's London to Wednesday's New York open so let's flesh out some more ideas about this what you're gonna be looking for is a higher time frame directional bias and there's a couple different ways you can do that and I teach those in the mentorship but if you'd like looking at a higher time frame charts like monthly and weekly charts they will aid you and assist you in determining that but this is a hourly and/or 30-minute time frame viewing the weekly perspective so that way you can see the entire daily range over the spectrum of the entire Sunday's open to Friday's closed what we want to be focusing on is the opening price on Sunday now some of you may not have Sunday candle in your platform and that's fine it's still beneficial for you to seek out whatever the sunday opening price is so you can use things like websites that follow the foreign exchange markets and get an opening price because sometimes these I think prices will create gaps from varieties closed those gaps are very indicative of sentiment and sometimes they could be exhaustive or they could be insightful and inform that it's showing underlying strengths if it gaps up it may not feel it may not trade back down and fill that gap entry higher it may just straight straight away you know Google North right from the higher opening on Sunday to open what we're looking for is well on Sunday's opening we want to see that opening price and extend it all the way to Friday keeping that in mind and I'll explain why that's important in a couple of minutes but we're primarily looking for is a power of three formation on the weekly range but from a 30-minute chart which is what we're showing here this is going to give us the intraday reference points and it'll show you how the market moves and gyrates with this in now if you choose not to use Sunday's data which i think is little myopic lamb or at least talking about the relationships of the opening price for the weekly range because they have to understand the debt still is there in terms of trading just because your platform may or may not have a Sunday scandal the market data in fact open many times hours before you would expect it to a fashion price when your Monday candle so it's beneficial free to go through and research and find out what you looking prices on your respective Forex pair that's what you're using you can elect to go with the opening price on Monday's trading but your data is going to be slightly skewed okay so whatever your first opening price is on Monday you can use that price and draw that across okay but if it's an instance where the market starts at a lower price level on Sunday we may not get the opportunity on Mondays opening price to dip down below it one more bullish or want to be a buyer at the opening price or below it okay so I use the Sunday's opening price to teach new traders because it teaches in number one sentiment it teaches them overbought oversold without the use of indicators okay and it also teaches you to trust a hard time frame premise what's the monthly weekly charts suggesting are they implying that we're gonna be moving higher or are we moving lower this example here is going to be framed on the basis that we elected by a way of analysis that the higher time frame charts are looking for higher prices so that means price is going to expand on the open one Sunday or shortly thereafter and having a higher close or at least expanding throughout the week to make a higher price level where we can hopefully find an opportunity to harvest some pips in terms of power three what we're seeing here is the relationship day by day and what price has done with that opening price but in terms of a weekly range if you're a short-term trader you can use this insight and not have to worry about day trading at all once you know the opening price you'll be anticipating that move down below the opening price now what level you choose to buy it down there there's lots of different ways you can do it and I teach a lot of them and it's not important for me to share with you any one particular setup because I've learned over the years teaching that some of my concepts don't always gel or more or less work for certain individuals it's not because the patterns are they're not you know favorable in terms of how to use them in the price action it's because of personality it I'll give you an example to be a buyer when the market creates a new low that is sometimes scary for certain traders and they won't want to do that other traders that see that and they say what makes perfect sense they will gravitate towards that type of pattern the ones that don't want to be buying below all lows that trader will probably do very well when they do optimal trade entry buys where it's proven it's gone up a little bit and it retraces it makes more sense for them to do that so that's why in a free content I'm avoiding that whole way of teaching because it gives the impression to the students or the first-time readers or viewers of my content that I'm trying to promote you to follow a specific mold okay or or press you into a specific mode which as a teacher and a trader I know that doesn't work you can't work okay it might work for some of you but I don't want to make my success as a mentor be based on just a handful of my students I have a way of teaching where the content is there for you to plug in play for your own personality and I do a lot of that stuff in the mentorship but for free content this is all you need to work with and you'll find all the setups you'll ever look for now we can fine-tune this principle and actually give you specific levels on what you would be buying at below the opening price both in a day traders perspective and/or a short-term trader so it's a short trend trader if you've watched my content and you've been well impressed with the ability to have that precise of an understanding you can still use these same concepts by way of using the opening price in trading the weekly candle so the weekly range or weekly candle they're synonymous terms okay but I use them in a tune interchangeably but for the sake of weekly range that's exactly what I'm talking about okay so what we're forming here is this particular week's entire data from the low of the week to the high that week this opening price is representative of the Sunday's opening price we would be already bullish on the week we would anticipate this movement from the open and down we would be interested in anything from the open to trade up first we would look at that as not interesting we would wait for it to drop down into an oversold condition what makes it oversold because its opening price is value okay that's fair value at the time of new trading at some point in the future we would anticipate the market dropping down okay that dropped down from the opening price it's going to make price in terms of what we bought or sold oversold because the context our premise behind it we would already be bullish relative to the monthly and weekly chart so if we're expecting them weekly try to continue higher the new week we would expect to see the opening price that drop down which is a Judas link this engineered move is to knock individuals are already out long or drive individuals that are not in the marketplace that want to sell short to entice them to do so any pending orders that would sell in a breakout it would be filled down on this movement here so you as a short-term trader you could elect to buy at one of these levels below the opening price that my tutorials teach some of but we go into great detail with that mentorship so you can frame all types of entry techniques and concepts they reside below the opening price okay wait Lee uses information from the free tutorial standpoint is if we know that the low of the week from the opening price on Sunday making a low of the week on this weekly range it's going to form between Sunday's opening and Wednesdays New York open the odds favor a greater chance of the low for me when you're bullish between the London set up and New York set up of Wednesday so Tuesday's on them set up to Wednesday's New York set up between these two time periods I'm going to encourage you to go through your charts it's really really easy to go through hindsight data and you'll see what I just told you is like the elephant in the room retail traders until I taught this stuff publicly on my youtube channel and in my to tour nobody was talking about this nobody was mentioning it no one was using it and the folks that tried to say they were always aware of it they showed examples in their trades and it never was there they were doing the things that were opposite to what this teaching teaches I've been doing this for two decades okay and only a few handful of individuals around the world had opportunity to learn from me you could read about 18 years ago or so and that's small little circle of individuals they and myself have the only ones have been really been aware of this type of phenomenon now since I made my tutorials there's been educators and stuff's they've linked on to what I teach any renamed it okay they call it a weekly strategy they call it you know whatever else they want to come up with and they add some kind of a twist in the title but once you see what they're doing it's what I've taught here and what I've taught in my previous teaching how to cache explosive price moves which is the free tutorial which I didn't like the presentation but if you watch that video or look at it the first couple minutes of that video is actually what I'm showing you here so once that was produced and shared on baby pips and that crowd watched it all there - they caught fire problem is is most traders they don't know what to do with it below the opening price one more bullish so which level do you buy in this instance I'm just gonna teach the classic market structure goal - optimal trade entry okay so you're gonna anticipate Tuesday to Wednesday's low forming now sometimes it's going to on on Monday but you can still get a continuation move on Tuesday or Wednesday but primarily I want you to be thinking how Tuesday to Wednesday in that time period that's when the weekly low is gonna form many times it's going to be Tuesday's long and open okay now if that's going over your head I want you to stop think about what I just told you though weekly low most likely forms on Tuesdays on an open when we're bullish if we are bullish and it does not form on Tuesday and we drop down on Wednesday Wednesday we'll probably be the low of the week if we go lower than the low formed on Wednesdays New York open you have to nix the trade and go to the sidelines on the day expecially if you took an opportunity on Tuesday or Wednesday and they were losing trades you have to stop and just submit to the fact that you're wrong even if Thursday or Friday it goes higher and that's a very hard lesson to learn because you were bullish on the week but you get stopped out and it still ends up going there and you've missed out on it that's going to happen it's happened to me many many times and it does not undo the effectiveness or the validity behind the setup there's going to be an imperfection in your trading so you have to permit that okay but if we're looking for too low the forum on Tuesday or Wednesday what we're simply looking for is a new low in the week preferably on Tuesdays on an open or Wednesdays New York Oakland okay between these two reference points should that occur okay soon as we have a lower low in a week formed we find the short term high prior to that new low forming in this case it's this here okay so when that occurs that's our trigger point so for individuals that want to buy on retracements with optimal trade entry we're going to wait for price to break above this short-term high which it does here from this point here you're going to be looking for the low the forum prior to this run-up now classic fib people will go from this low to this high sometimes that'll work sometimes it won't what I want you to look at is we have the most dynamic price movement off of this low so you're gonna anchor your fib on the lowest close or open in that swing low drag it all the way up to this body here now I don't have that in here cuz I want the two presentations to be clean because my watermark on top of the chart and my references I'm showing you here I want you to go through and look at this for yourself go through your own data it the November 21st and 22nd of 2017 use a 30-minute chart and you'll be able to see going that fib that low to this high you get an optimal trade entry beautifully lined up right there and there's your continuation by and here's the thing you're buying it below the weekly open one Sunday you're buying below that weekly open trying to do power three one week this gives us the best advantage okay to be in before the expansion that takes place on the weekly range because we're buying below evaluation that would deemed as fair and it drops down to an oversold condition so while everyone else would look at these movements dropping down here and dropping down here as momentum on the downside our perspective is like the smart money we're looking at that as it going down to an area of a really really cheap price so if you're terribly afraid just you know to step in there right when it breaks below to a new low I understand that but over time you're gonna have to you know encounter that and just move past it or just elect to go with often trade entry as your your pattern and there's certainly nothing wrong with it but if you're wanting to buy up here and you're always gonna wrestle with the idea I wish I would have bought down there this is only going to occur if you buy at new lows at a time when it should be creating the low the week in like I said it's hard to do that without just getting in here and desensitizing yourself by practicing it practicing in a demo account and doing it live with a demo over and over and over again to the point where you just don't care if the outcome is going to be profitable or not because that's what it takes to be consistent you're not worrying about the end result you just trust the process of what you're doing eventually over time the sample sizes are more weighted on the positive side of what you're expecting to see then that of the temporary and sometimes you know unwanted negative results that is missing the trade or getting stopped out so this would be the optimal trade entry again it's on a day that we would look for to form Wednesday and priced our to expand we get about above the opening price preferably we want to see price show a willingness to want to expand away from the opening price and not want to come back down to it now there are some certain caveats to this and I'll add this to you just to you'd be a little bit more splice on this if we make the low of the week on Monday how do we know that it trades back above the opening price okay one Monday and expands a little bit more okay this right here we dropped down and went back above the opening price I don't trust this because it's Monday and I like to see the Monday's range okay I want to see what the money's entire daily ranges so I don't I don't get the weekly loads many times actually Isis be fair about about 90% of the time if the week makes it slow on Monday I'm missing that because I elect to sit many times on the sidelines because I want to use the range of Monday to give me insights so on Tuesday I like to get hopefully a lower low when I'm bullish and then I'll buy in here okay based on some pattern or some kind of a key level I teach and I'll ride that out and hopefully get back above the opening price now if we trade above the opening price one say Tuesday I will permit Wednesday to see retracement back down the opening price funds and support and then rally back away on Wednesday if we're breaking above the opening price on Wednesday it cannot it should not come back to opening price now again in simple terms Wednesday is de line in the sand if it trades above the opening price one more bullish we do not permit it to come back down to the opening price it can happen if we go above the opening price on a new low on Tuesday we could still see it come back down and retest the opening price on Wednesday the algorithm will want to expand away from this opening price after Wednesday because it only has newer opens time period to Friday's closed and that's why you see this acceleration in the movement on the weekly range nealy after wednesday breaks above the opening price now you're gonna look at this and I'm gonna be criticized by folks that don't like what I'm teaching because they're you know sold one indicators or whatever else they're doing or they don't like the fact that I'm right they're going to say this is being cherry picked in hindsight capacity well grant I am hand picking this in hindsight to show you because it's already happened anyone teaching you anything is going to be some level of hindsight I'm telling you to go through your charts and you will see this yourself as many as examples that you're gonna find you're gonna see quickly what I'm telling you is the gospel okay it's just the way it is you can argue and wrestle with this but if you trade against this premise you may understand why you're losing money okay so once we get through the opening price on Wednesday and or on Tuesday or Monday Monday I personally will never get the low on Monday you know we clean low I won't get that on Monday you can try to test that theory and buy down here and you might get something like this and this could have kept on going if you're going to trade on Monday if it trades back to the opening price my opinion is is to take some profits there and leave a stop in so that way if it does not yeah it protects any open profits but leave it in there because you might have caught the tiger by the tail statistically studying all the possible scenarios and weekly protocols that I teach I elected to simply wait till Tuesday and that's just the way I do it obviously I'm not encouraging to follow me step by step but I'm doing it and telling you this because I want to be open about how I do it Tuesday I'm really actively looking at London open okay that's really what I'm looking for so between London open on Tuesday and some of these opening I'm really not doing much at all I'm just relaxing and spending family time I glanced at the charts but I'm not really trying to actively pursue anything until around 1:00 and open on Tuesday and if you look at the weekly ranges on the front currency pairs you'll see that many times we are in the bullish or bearish these turning points will form on Tuesdays on and open but for this example here we're bullish and we're looking at the opening price on Sunday you want to see it drop down it trades down to a level we wait for it to break a swing high okay this could have easily formed on Monday and the retracement could have been occurring on Tuesday like it is here on Wednesday and in Tuesday could have trades to do claim price and we could still permit it to come back down to that once a retest of the weekly open but after that it's not allowed to do it again if it ever starts to gravitate back down to that opening price after Wednesday trading through it it's probably made a reversal or it's going to consolidate for the rest of the week either one's not good for a weekly expansion now there's going to be times where we'll trade above the opening price on the weekly range and not go very far and just gravity right back to the opening price and it's going to be a quiet next week if it's still bullish the following week would still use the same criteria okay but the next stage would be really expecting that expansion here now this portion of the weekly range is going to be what you're holding for an event say until Friday's closed your mindset should be not trying to find 10 pips or give me 20 pips okay I start my week off looking for scenarios that get me in down below the opening price because I understand it below the opening price is the ideal entry point for all my day trades and my short-term trading as a short-term to swing trader you can use that insight using the weekly ranges and not require yourself to be anywhere near an hourly or four-hour chart or anything less than that so there's no reason for folks that watch my beer my my videos and I'll say well you know I'm not a day trader I can't use this information it's interesting ICT but I just I can't do that you have no excuse because of this gave you a bazooka okay this gave you the ability to go in there and short-term or sling trade using the opening price on Sunday okay wait for it to drop down and simply go in and handle it now I will toss this out there and you guys can test this theory on your own okay if at any time you are bullish on a weekly range if the opening price and we drop down say 30 pips okay if we drop 30 pips from the opening price on Sunday test this theory out if you're bullish buy 30 pips below the opening price one Sunday and use a hundred and 50 pips top this is for swing traders not short-term traders okay and let that go and see if you don't get 150 to 300 pips test that theory and give me your feedback through Twitter you try this on any pair really any kind of market really but for forex I'm gonna give you that suggestion now it does not mean that you won't see it drop down sometimes 50 to 75 pips okay but generally your stop-loss of 150 pips after buying below the opening buy 30 pips what you're really doing is you're saying I don't believe in to go down 180 pips from the opening price if it's truly bullish we won't spend a whole lot of time below the opening price and it won't go that far down below it unless we are changing long term in a reversal from a bearish market to a bullish market then we can see some really wild reaches below the opening price which I don't look for those anyway I want to be looking in a marketplace that's already in position to be moving it has been moving for a while longer term and I'm just getting in positioning myself in a logical area where the next upside is clearly an expansion or bullish up close for Friday okay the weekly smart money view or bearish conditions okay you can see here we have the same thing dis reversed we're looking for the weekly high to form between Sunday and Wednesday high odds between Wednesday's New York open 7 a.m. from Sunday's opening that's what we're looking for but the odds further increase again between Tuesdays and Wednesdays trading specifically focusing on Tuesday's long and open to Wednesday's New York open ok so we're looking at the weekly range here for this particular currency this happens to be a dollar cad and you can see how price didn't I have a up movement on Monday and then we had another movement up on Tuesday creating the high of the week during the London session or what we were looking for for the scenario overall we anticipate a bearish week ahead of the open once that opening price is derived on Sunday we extend that through the entire week until Friday's close movements above the opening price we anticipate that we want to see price go to a level that would push price into a technically overbought condition there is no overbought indicator on my chart I'm reading price action the fact that we're trading above the opening price in an market environment that's bearish longer-term that's what frames my idea over highly weak forms on Tuesday Wednesday we barely have any type of movement whatsoever we still have a little blip on the radar as price runs it back above that opening price and then quickly rejects notice that once it leaves that opening price on Wednesday it doesn't try to go back to it now it does retrace here but it's not getting close to it if it does it's going to be a mixed week we don't want to be a part of that okay and ultimately price comes down sales this old low and let me see a reversal that's outside the scope or the focus the point we're looking for is we want to be when we're bearish we're looking to sell short one or at very close to the weekly high in riding that down to some measure of expansion below the weekly opening price so in terms of the weekly range or weekly candle what we're looking at is the opening price here then we're seeing the Judas swing this is the portion of price action that we're anticipating we anticipate this type of price action and we want to have a level in mind before it starts to even trade up where we're wanting to sell short in this example a real good example would be we have a high here and a Monday's high so we have relatively equalized price stabs above this you could be a seller here and I did in fact take this trade and I shared it on Twitter you guys can see that go through my Twitter feed look at the date for around November 21st 22nd I would have shown the example and I my entry points and everything's in there so short with the expectation that there's going to be a sell-off on the dollar cad price sells off goes below the opening price now remember what I said as long as it is before Wednesday's New York open its permissible see price trade back to in this case above the opening price because on Wednesday that's when it should leave the gate once it starts leaving that opening price it's going to expand to reach for some measure of price action that creates the movement below the open price so the range expansion portion of the weekly range that's what you're holding for but you want to be positioned up here while price is going up when it's long term bearish it feels scary it feels odd it feels out of place because you're watching price shoot up like this and every retail minded trader out there and every person that's on Twitter and Facebook they're gonna be looking at this thing saying it's going to the moon and it's not it's a southbound train once this thing leaves the station which is the opening price on Wednesdays new york open draw that line on your chart once that occurs it should always try to expand away from the opening price you should have a predetermined level where you're going to be getting out at inside of this expansion okay in this case we have relatively equal lows here we have a low here we have a low here so if we go about 10 to 20 cuts below that that would give us around 26 95 and that's 26 95 right here that gives us to this price point here it goes a little bit lower but then author link comes back with a deep retracement and then closes end of the week giving us the weekly candle or range profile like the ideal scenario is to look for a cell above the opening price as a day trader you could be focusing in on that and or as a short-term trader or swing trader you can use the weekly candle or weekly range to trade entirely off of that and not even look at an intraday chart not even a daily chart you can take these types of trades and again look for that same scenario waiting for it to trade about 30 pips above the opening price okay in this case here we opened around here we can go up 10 20 30 pips so you could be a seller around 2005 and a stop loss of 150 points or pips okay and try to get 150 to 300 pips profit from them by selling at 120 805 or thereabouts price goes all the way down to a low of approximately 26 75 I gave you this example to see and show you how even using the objective of 150 pips - 300 pips you may not get that actually in your profit which is why I teach to take partial profits so if we sold short hypothetically at 120 805 or whatever 30 pips would be above that opening price if we sold there with the expectation that we're gonna try to capture a hundred fifty pips or more as soon as you made a hundred pips why wouldn't you want to bank they're seeing that we're probably only gonna make about 130 pips on this move on your pip movement anytime your moves ever traded a hundred pip intervals you have to take something off learn to do that if you do not do that I promise you you will look back and regret not having done so so as a day trader you know obviously if it moves on our pips you certainly when we banking 80% of your position and if you're a short-term trader you want to be at least half your position out because the weekly can change gears midweek for instance it could have went down to this low here and in trading on to Tuesday high those occurrences can happen so if it's offered up a hundred take something off at 100 pips regardless of what style or what type of integral up trader you are if it gives you a hundred pips pay yourself on those hundred pips even if it's one tenth of your position overall do it because it number one it'll feel good to do so it'll pay you for your time and the risk that you put in and it teaches you the value of doing overtime the folks that say that partial profits are stupid or idiotic you shouldn't do it because the full risk was what it was the beginning the risk is going to change preferably it's gonna reduce over the life of the trade anyway but that same initial risk does not guarantee full profit the assumptions that use just because you put a specific number of risk percentage on at the beginning trade and it's stupid to take partial profits because you risk this much but you don't how many times have your trades gone to full profit how many times have you failed to take something off if you just would have taken something before it turned back on you that's what I've been doing for 25 years folks okay 25 years I seen enough of this to no partial pays okay it pays you have to give yourself the ability to take something out because the market is not going to do it for you you have to take it out so if you're gonna be a short-term or swing trader you want to use that weekly range like this if we expand a hundred pips we're looking for 150 to 300 pips for the week you're not always gonna get 300 pips but preferably if we're bearish in this case we want to see hopefully a big weekly range remember this small range big range going on well if we're starting to see small weekly ranges right ahead of this and we're still bearish if we get this scenario here we can do very very well you can see those big 300 sometimes even 500 pip ranges on a weekly especially if it's gonna be a lot of news a lot of things that are happening you know economic calendar it can be extremely volatile and it creates a large range on the weekly so the model is we look for if you're a short-term swing trader that can't be in the intraday stuff you can sell short above the opening price about 30 pips now you can fancy dance that you can say well I'm gonna be a seller at 40 pips above the opening price a rockin if it trades up 50 pips above the opening price I could be a seller there okay and look for 150 pips to 300 pips again with the expectation you're not always going to get 300 pips but if it allows you to make a hundred pips when you take your first partial off and put your stop at breakeven you're in a beautiful position because if you take say hey if your position off at 100 pips could you stop at breakeven and then see if it gives you any more movement for the rest of the week once the examples come by looking at Pine site data and seeing what's available you will quickly see whether this is for you or not I'm not trying to twist your arm I'm just giving those individuals that don't have the ability to sit in here every single day watching intraday price action a way they use this information on a higher time frame you know allow them to participate now if you are able to look at the market Tuesday or Wednesday and you only have to do it on those days around Tuesday's run and open and Wednesdays London open if you watch those specific time points you can look at specific levels in price action that I teach in my tutorials and go into great detail with the mentorship you can sell at a more favorable entry point and you won't have to just say okay well here's the opening price on Sunday I'm going to take a set number of pips above the opening price all the time and sell short there when I'm bearish you can avoid that okay and you can say okay well I'd say open here okay I'm gonna watch and see what Monday does Monday's dilly-dallying around create some Monday high here and we start trading here we start to drop down ahead up one then we're not interested in that we're looking for this high in this high here double tops okay what's gonna be resting above that buy stops so if you know that going ahead of Tuesday's on an open you could just simply do a sell limit order right above the high on Friday or a high on Monday and then you can really reduce the amount of exposure you have and then still have that same 100 keep it profit objective hopefully they
