  "fullText": "all right folks welcome back this is episode number eight applying institutional order flow to forex markets all right folks welcome back taking a look at trading view and i promise this is going to be a really short one tonight um let's go to euro and whenever i'm looking at data from trading view this is the data feed i use for forex pairs only forex.com i don't want definitely not them all right so we have the daily chart up for euro yen just so you know i hate the end pairs i can't stand them but but for the sake of completeness this is how you would look for these types of patterns in forex now i have lots of feedback in the comments section that you don't get to see but it's really just for me i get a lot of requests whether or not this is appropriate to be using for higher time frame charts and i think daily charts are what everyone classifies a higher higher time frame chart so i want you to take a look at shark fry do any mock up on it pause the video if you're not ready still don't pause it to you all right take a look at the relative equal lows over you see that it's gonna go quick and dirty tonight right and dirty all right so we have relative equal lows marked out over here the market has traded down through and created a run higher now here is why i do not like the end pairs okay i get questions all the time why don't you like again pairs icd they move around nice they do this they do that they tend to have like a double return to a specific level i like to see and you're going to see it right here okay swing high the market rallies through that there's no fair value out there it drops back down in then it runs again taking out this swing high so we have two points of market structure that have moved to the upside in order its price is traded above it now this leg here you want to go back through that and see is there a fair value gap well we have one and two market trades down into it here sends it higher what's above here buy side liquidity this old high back here could be a draw on liquidity as well so there's gonna be buy stops whether it trades there or not it's irrelevant okay it's likely to draw to it just like you know playing horseshoes you play the game horseshoes not every single time you throw a horseshoe is it going to go on that post but it's still fun to play right so you're aiming at that post whether you hit that post or not and this would be like the post in the game playing horseshoes you're just aiming for it now obviously we started trading a new day here but this candle which was the 10th of february 2022 this daily candle we could trust that this was likely to go higher because we went up we've consolidated and then start another run into this high here again whether it trades through it or not it's irrelevant okay because even a failure swing to get above old highs if there's enough range from being right here at the open to reaching up to here that's enough to take a stab at it and see if you're going to get any kind of yield so that's an example of it occurring on a daily chart but i want to go into this very day right there okay the 10th so we're going to drop down into a 15 minute time frame all right here's a 15 minute time frame and we're going to mark up our chart midnight new york time rocket rallies in here yeah and then we go into the new york session right here so we're going to go into this price structure and fair it out the run that occurred in here so i'm going to put a rectangle in this area so that way we know what we're looking at relative to this 15 minute time frame you guys ask why i do powerpoint slides this is the reason why it makes it a lot easier to go right to what i'm looking for all right we're gonna drop down to a five minute chart okay and if you take a look at seven o'clock in the morning 10 o'clock in the morning that's your new york ict killzone okay that's the time of day that new york session trades form i have more information in that regard for time of day for forex in this channel i said lots of videos lots of topics and things you can explore i don't want to beat it to death because i've already done in other places but just know that seven o'clock in the morning 10 o'clock in the morning new york time again on trading view you need to have it toggled to that everything else it'll be wrong all right so here is the time of day at the forming of a new york setup forms all right so we have the market trading down takes out a swing low trades down below that and then punches higher right above this swing high inside this price like right here is there a fair value gap we're going to start breaking it down top down from five minute top down we're gonna break it down from the five minute down to the one minute chart so from this low up to this high right in there that's we're gonna study on each new time frame so i'll go down to three minutes okay so in this price leg here do we take out a swing low yes we trade down below swing low does it take out a swing high here yes it does so now we have a valid condition to see if there's a trade go back through this price leg is there a fair value got right in here and this one here so remember i was teaching you it could stab down there just be mindful of that but try to get your entry in on that one there and that's what we have here trace that to it there now the question is going to be is how far will it trade to because we're not looking at anything over here because a middle of the range type idea so for expansion type moves practical lesson tonight where if we don't have a range to trade inside of how do we anticipate how far can trade up or trade down in this case we're looking for a long where would our targets be because the old high is over here now i'm sure if we went to a hard time frame keep looking to the left we'll find something but a real easy way is to take your price leg over here see this swing low break prior to this run up then we consolidated drop down create a discount and then create our retracement rally and start to run up into these highs how can we know well i like to take a fib anchor it let go of my and anchor it to a previous swing okay so from this low that is high after we leave this consolidation it starts to trade higher um standard deviation negative one and i got a lot of questions you know what's my setup for my fib i actually show that on the ote primer video so you're welcome to take a look at that on the youtube channel as well 133.153 and that's not that let's see hi is 133 15 and three so right to the right to the point that you'd be looking for and then we've seen it received from that okay so obviously when i show example like this makes me want to trade me in but i hate this pair i can't stand there's other markets that can scratch my itch for 4x but this one is not one i like to trade but i wanted to come out tonight and kind of give you a quick view of what you could do with these markets using the model okay there is a approach that you can use with the london session okay and london would be marking up your vertical lines relative to new york local time two o'clock in the morning to five a.m so you'd have your your bracket so your operating hours would be hunting the setup for new york between seven o'clock in the morning and ten o'clock local new york time for london session trades you would look for setups that would provide you a way to trade a fair value gap between two o'clock in the morning and five o'clock in the morning okay and that's as easy as i can make it for you it's simple and any additional information you would want to have i have absolutely covered it in other videos in this youtube channel okay so it's predominantly a forex channel and it's only been recently with the 2022 mentorship i'm talking and teaching about the stock indices so i got a lot of requests for 4x so here you go it's simply applying what you've been trained with the futures indices but just applying it to the forex market but applying it to the time of day relative to new york or london and yes you can take trades in asia yes you can take trades in london close but i'd prefer to have you just trade on these two time frames here or time of day rather being new york open which is what's being shown here seven o'clock tomorrow ten o'clock in the morning new york local time again always i can't say it enough because if you don't do this and you just have it set to your local time it won't work but it's new york local time on trading view seven o'clock to ten o'clock this is the time when you're hunting the setup okay so in summary we can anticipate this market going higher why because the euro dollar is going higher you can also check it by going to let's go to daily chart first and you can go to 6e which is euro futures and let us use the front month continuous okay you can see how euro where has it been going so has it been going lower or higher clearly going higher what has the yen been doing so when you look at forex pairs you want to look for that relationship between the instruments that make up your pair so euro yen euro is strong yen is weak so what would that mean for euro yen it would mean that if your bias is bullish and you have this underpinning between euro and yen it's going to make this pair go higher it's a real simple way of looking at how to determine these exotic crosses okay and how to frame the logic behind whether it should go higher or lower and then apply time today wait for the pattern i'm teaching you and you won't need to do anything else you don't need to buy a subscription to anybody's services you don't need to learn anything else you don't have to buy any courses it's all right here for free and it works until i talk to you next week enjoy weekend and be safe"
