  "fullText": "all right so this is going to be an update to the YouTube channel because there's a lot of people freaking out thinking I'm missing or gone I'm on vacation folks but uh I took the opportunity to sit down here this morning with you and try to hopefully make a mile marker on the equity on this Live account I'm going to try to hit ,000 so I'm watching this potentially make a fair value Gap I want to see that swing High broken let's see if we get that here and again this account is really meant to show like averaging like 20% a month I get questions all the time like you know what do I think a student that has gone through all the teachings have worked out a model you know what could they recently expect to see and what could be done without really pushing the envelope and this is kind of like my answer to that also to kind of like remind everybody I'm not just finding cherry pick trades in AO account I can trade with live funds too all right so we're about to break that swing high if it does that'll be bullish Market structure I'm thinking we can trade back to on the daily chart back to like 14,000 but that's a little bit of a stretch so far intraday okay we have the market structure bullish now so there's a fair value Gap I'll highlight that I'll go into the chart here I'm watching this candle see how it closes because that will complete our imbalance so you can see that right there okay give me another right there that's the low end of the fair value G this thing's always tricky all right so now we have to close of that candle so now I can I'm a little off on that cuz I'm clumsy with uh thinker swim change the color here so you can see a little bit better now it's technically the open so it's a little bit of volatility that comes in here it can overshoot that low I don't care if it does if it goes back up into the fair value capap I will buy it okay now when you're entering on like the opening like 9:30 equities opening uh you could take a long entry here but you don't know how far it's going to whip below that low and you could be wrong and painfully wrong so what I'm watching is does it want to go below that short-term low that's already created moments ago which would be outside and below the fair value Gap and it does not negate the fair value Gap because I'm using narrative narrative is is I expect people to look at that and say okay it's going to go up and they're already trying to buy right now now but their stop loss is going to be below that swing low so sell stops are resting at 13,612 they just took those now now this is a high-risk entry long there but I'm watching price now entering that same fair value got so one more time to see if it wants to poke a little bit lower and I'm again my daily bias is bullish so I'm looking for higher prices so I'm going to go and aim for the 80 level that'll give me a nice figure to run to 50,000 on Equity I do believe it's going to go higher but I'm on vacation so I want to kind of like let me take this long entry and there you go all right so now I'm watching price and I want to see it expand up now because it's the opening and I don't know where if we whip below that low I'll give it a chance to go below it just by a little bit and I'll close it at Market generally I like to trade with a stop loss but if I'm trading the open like this stops can be taken really really easily and then reverse and then never give you a chance to be in it so I'm allowing myself a little bit of flexibility I'm not trying to encourage you to trade without a stop LX believe me I'm I'm right here ready to click and close it if it trades below it and I want to see to expand up now I want to see an energetic run above the swing high that was formed just to the left of where we are right now there is a fair value Gap at the 680 level and it's above equilibrium so it would be a premium market so that's why I'm going to be targeting the 80 level plus it's around 50 handle so that gives me about $1,000 or more all right so now right now at this moment I want to see it expand aggressively not you dilly dally around I want to see it really try to spread its wings and take off and start moving there's a small little fair value Gap in the last three candles up I don't think it needs to fill that in or even revisit it but if it were to I would expect price to be you know supported by that so other words not going below the 630 level okay now at this moment I could put the stop loss on at my entry and if it takes me out then I'm would basically move to the sidelines and wouldn't take any more trades today because it's F1 see and FC you can trade in the morning but you got to be done early if you're trading equities it's important to be aware of the economic calendar because we're probably going to have a lot of volatility later on today I still think they'll push it higher with that so here's my limit order I'm going place it there and we'll see if we can get this puy to reach up there and grab it I mean I feel confident it's going to go way beyond that but short little Scout out very little draw down about three handles of draw down if that from the entry or the the candle I entered I want to say it that way the low from my entry was only like three handles below I have to have to go watch the video and see what the actual draw down was from the point of entry I'm not sure if I had any if I did then that's what it was limited to 60 bucks or so not bad if you're trying to make $1,000 had a small little Scout early in the morning all right and now this is where neight Traders or newbies they get nervous hit the wrong thing here I always think I'm on the other platforms I use a trade station and I use trading View and it's different settings and different things you can look for all right so there's my fill on the limit order rounding out the day and the month of March I will not be taking any more trades this month so $1,255 on two trades about $15 or so in commissions so take that off of there that will be the net for the day I'll take you over to the monitor tab here after I scrunch this up and show you the the run on the price now I think it's going to go higher but here's the monitor tab showing the actual trades today and you can see the profit and loss since I started this account and the commissions which are high
