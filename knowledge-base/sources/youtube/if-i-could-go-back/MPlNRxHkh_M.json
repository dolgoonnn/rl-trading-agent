  "fullText": "okay folks welcome back this is part three of a continuing series of four videos if I could go back and tell myself what I knew now again this is a hypothetical conversation with my younger self purely fiction just to give you a perspective on if I tell myself what to focus on when I first started it would hopefully have a voted majority of the painful lessons and losses that I had to incur how would I practice where do you back test daily setups you know before I get into this this whole series is really linked to the optimal trade entry pattern that I could have made public on my youtube channel I've also included 20 videos of daily setup so that way it kind of gives you familiarity to what this pattern looks like across a wide array of different asset classes but I'm covering a simplistic approach to how you should be practicing first and foremost everyone knows broker demo platforms okay so whenever you open up an account with a broker generally they offer you a trial version of their platform so you can test your strategies or whatever it is that you're utilizing for your framework for your setups you can test drive it on a demo account Forex has the ability to offer demo accounts that for some brokers don't expire and it's not a big deal if it does expire you just start another one but you don't want to treat the demo account like monopoly money you want to sit down with it and say okay how much of this hypothetical pretend money would I be utilizing if I was trading it wouldn't have been $50,000 to start with and working with a demo with a sober mind about what you're doing and building good habits and removing the opportunity to fall into bad habits that means over trading looking for setups even after you've made a correct decision and the market shows you that you would have been profitable it's not an invitation to go right back in the same day to try to get something else because it felt good you're going to fall victim to that early on so to avoid all that don't have it in your mindset you have to take a lot of trades every single day you're going to lose a lot of money you don't know it yet but you're going to lose a lot of money trying to do that and third-party apps like forex tester and you can go to forex tester comm and they have a medium where you can go back and back test strategies and such and then finally trading view calm today which doesn't exist at the time of you coming up now Michael the trading view calm website offers pretty much everything that was available when you started meta stock super charts tradestation all those things and bells and whistles that you're liking right now aren't really that important you're going to focus primarily on the open the high the low and the close it doesn't feel like that that's where you're gonna be heading but eventually you're gonna strip all the indicators off your chart Michael and you're not even gonna consider any of it it doesn't make sense to you right now but trust me everything becomes clear by not having anything on your charts you not to have any overlays of your platform indicators you like stochastic right now it's not going to ever appear in your chart anymore you like MACD it's never going to appear on your chart anymore Michael you want to strip the chart down and focus on the for price levels that is the most paramount it's the open the high the low and the close and looking at different intervals the previous day's highs and lows previous weeks highs and lows in previous month's highs and lows will offer a plethora of setups it doesn't feel like that makes sense to you right now but it will absolutely unlock all of the understanding that you'll need the carve-out consistent steady setups so let's go into treating view and look at how we can practice all right so here is the trading view platform and I have the chart set up with the euro dollar currency pair on the left hand side it is a 15-minute time frame and on the right hand side it's a daily chart and the assumption is that we're focusing on the optimal trade entry on a higher time frame until it delivers to a key level and I'm going to show you right now what that would look like here we have a high that would be targeted in here as the price was rallying up we can see before we got to this high back testing these types of setups is what you would be doing we're going to show a Fibonacci on this swing low with dis candles higher low and this candles higher low surrounding this one particular candle that's why I'm anchoring it to that and I'm dragging it all the way up to this candles high because it's as it's making higher highs I'm gonna overlay the fib on every successive higher high because that's going to be the range in which any retracement comes it'll be within that range and it'll be apparent when you see it here so we draw this up so that okay so you can see the Fibonacci that's anchored from this low up to this high it captures this retracement now this candle right here is the 10th of July 2020 here's 10 from the 15 minute sign crane you can see how the 50 minute time frame drops down into the optimal trade entry which is d 60 to 70% of tracing level and 70.5 sweet spot this level is going to be one of the levels you're going to like a lot but you'll save yourself a lot of frustration if you just use the 62 percent treatment level Michael most of the trades that you're hunting in these next couple years are going to be unwilling to traded a seventy point five or even 79 percent treatment level but here just simply used a 62% tracing level and defer the insatiable desire for you to find the perfect entry all the time later on in your 40s you're going to feel real comfortable with not having the absolute best entry and the absolute best exit there's lots and lots of opportunity in between so 62 percent and trade some level one here is ideal and we can actually see a key reaction off that 62% trade some level price starts to move higher now your focus is to imagine every daily candle moving higher open near the low of the day close near the high today up close is the mode of delivery and we're expecting until we get to this high so when we get up to it and through it okay remember that slogan to it and through it to it and through it that's how you're going to find the easiest bread-and-butter setups there is in every market asset class the idea is the framework is this optimal trade entry is going to keep delivering until we get to this high and slightly above it here is 1/2 a standard deviation and it's calling for 1 1446 and 2 pipettes ok the actual high of this price point as of the time of this discussion the high comes in at 114 52 and one pipette so it goes a little bit above it but that's a good idea as a target if not just simply at the old high now we're going to take our concentration away from the daily chart because we can clearly see what the benefit of hindsight here that we had a series of up close candles and each day you'd be hunting in New York setup now this is going to be the easiest framework Michael if you just submit to it early on stop trying to find trades outside of this time frame focus in here and you're going to find everything that you would ever need so all of our attention is going to go over to this chart here so scrubbing forward a little bit you can see the daily dividers and what you're going to do is you're going to take a line segment if you use the rectangle if you want and you're going to delineate on the chart each day 8:30 to 11 o'clock in the morning New York time so when you've studied this time you're going to be able to see a retracement lower because remember that the framework is every day the daily candles are going to go higher that is what you'll later the as the power three this high is going to be attacked but each day is going to be accumulation manipulation and distribution the accumulation is going to be near the love day there are accumulating long positions you're going to see that movement up going into New York New York session is 8:30 to 11 o'clock and as the market retraces lower in there inside that consolidation and retracement you're going to find a five-minute optimal trade entry that means a low swing high down in that doesn't take out the previous swing low trades to the 62 percent retracement level your stop would be below the low that creates the optimal trade entry you would go long at 62 Plus spread and reach for a previous day's high or a combination of that and the standard deviations on the Fibonacci that being like this is one standard deviation this is one half a standard deviation and so on so each day you can start the sea and back test how many pips that using the sixty-two percent in treatment level would give you plus the spread for your entry that you would have risked to get that trade on and how many pips it delivered how long the trade took from entry to delivery to your target how much of a drawdown did each setup take you want to consider that because if you have a large sample set of data not every trades going to start and turn right at the 62% retracement level you might have to incur some drawdown and don't make a big deal of it Michael because you're gonna have a lot of trades and they're not always going to be reacting as soon as you get in many times the fact that they don't react right away is indicative of you being on of you being offside and it's probably better for you to just kill the trade altogether but that's another lesson another time the next day again 8:30 to 11:00 you're going to look for the price structure that London creates a run and then a retracement down into between 8:30 and 11:00 this your optimal trade entry and when you see that again 62% tracing level aiming for a previous day's high previous day's highs here so you're gonna aim for a run through that and then add your standard deviations on your Fibonacci tool for targets same premise how I'm gonna take you to get to profitability and cover the dealer spread how many pips did you incur and draw down how much time did it take to get to target all of that is building up a sample set of backlogs this backlog is what you go back through and study for a hindsight derived experience and by doing this it will program your expectations to not perfect but it will also show like we're showing here an instance where an optimal trade industry doesn't really necessarily perform and even if you use this one and down in getting in long your stop below this would have been tagged so you would have a loss so how much times you take before getting stopped out how many pips did it move against you from your initial entry and how it traded for the day all of these ideas give you again perspective if you would have held on to this trade and didn't use a stop loss or kept moving a stop loss down as you will have done because you've made those mistakes early on already and you're gonna make those mistakes for another year and a half because you're gonna wrestle with the idea of being right it's not about being right Michael it's about being consistent and flexible when you can see the signals that are indicating that you're wrong or offside you have to kill it don't arm-wrestle it there's so many opportunities if you try to blow your account on one particular trading day because you can't accept the fact that you were wrong you can't accept that you're human then you're going to struggle more than you have to and that's why I'm talking to you right now I don't want you to go through all that because at 47 turning 48 soon these problems that you're going to encounter if you don't listen to me are still going to be painful to relive or remember how much information do you use from this bad example in terms of profitability but good example for learning you don't want to torture yourself and say well I was stupid because it was you know really screaming against me or I should have saw these multiple attempts to go higher and break down and I just picked a really bad trade and I was foolish for doing it don't do those types of things Michael don't filled your journal up with toxic thinking you're gonna fill up the first three years of journals with a lot of things that are going to be linked to your subconscious and you're gonna look at the markets and you're gonna remember and this looks like that time I lost X amount of money and didn't use a stop or I didn't get out when I should have gotten out and you're reliving all those painful moments that you journaled your going to use your journal to have positive constructive not negative criticism but positive criticisms it's important for you to frame your annotations in your journal in such a way there's no emotions whatsoever none but you still want to pull out the information that's salient to the lesson because when you're wrong you need to study what led to you being wrong so that way eventually you're gonna key up on the things that you're doing that are problematic and you're falling victim to over and over again but until you study them with a sober mind and objectively you're gonna keep falling victim to it and you're not going to understand why it's happening not only will you lose a lot of money but you're going to have a lot of frustration that's completely avoidable if you just do that this gave you right now the next day same thing we're not looking for every single day to be a winner we're expecting it's going to be a trade there may not pan out but we're staying with the same narrative we're looking for this day here's a sixteenth and that is on the daily right here that's this day here now that's a down close candle when you see this okay you're gonna see this hi and the next camel has a lower hi that's swing hi it's gonna make you think early on that it's creating a top and there's no more buy signals to take don't believe that just because it's making a swing high doesn't mean it's not going to likely give you another buying opportunity even on that particular day it gives us an optimal straight entry here and you want to study again 62% rates on level how much time did it take the cover dealing spread and move to target how many pips did it offer and even though it didn't get to the previous day's high by taking out scaled profits you don't have to be right about the next trade running to the previous day's high when you're bullish short term highs in here as it runs up you want to take profits off there and when you back test and practice you would be doing the same thing assuming that if you were in a trade you would take something off here and you'll take something off here and as it goes up into this area over here you may have been expecting it to trade above here but in this case it turns around how much time did you stay in the trade while I was drought you're dropping down here how long would you expect the hole under that trade before you realize you were wrong and be honest about it because what you pour into your back testing and practicing while it's hindsight if you are not honest with yourself if you put in poor expectations you're going to get ridiculously backwards results you're going to expect certain things that aren't realistic to see in terms of outcome and you're going to be at the mercy of your emotions and you're going to be pulled around by a psychological tug-of-war about being right or wrong if you don't do these things so the next day even though we had a losing day here in this trade while it was profitable it didn't deliver to the previous day's high it's fine you stick with the narrative next trading day here it is 8:30 to 11 optimal trade entry it's dropping down and it gives us two opportunities it drops into it here and guess is another one here and then takes out the previous day's high here so we have now delivered a setup that takes out the previous day's high and this is Friday so you can't trade the next day it's a Saturday but how many pips did it take from entry to scaling at your previous day's high how many pips was that how much time did it take how many pips did you have and drawdown all of those ideas you build a backlog of and in on the weekends you want to study how each one of these work together to complement one another in other words how did the previous days of trading setup the situation you saw on the next day and look at it from a hourly perspective a daily perspective and it'll help you frame out the institutional order flow that you'll become known for in the Forex division so in this case following this criteria and practicing every single day just keeping a backlog of it you're going to not only train yourself to see the setup but you're going to grow and you're understanding about how the characteristics repeat over and over and over again and staying with just one currency but framing all the ideas on a higher time frame basis that leads to high consistency without having to need perfection so I hope you have found this one insightful I will be back again next week with the final portion of the series how to transition into practice into live funds until then that was good luck and good trading",

      "text": "how would I practice where do you back test daily setups you know before I get into this this whole series is really linked to the optimal trade entry pattern that I could have made public on my youtube channel I've also included 20 videos of daily setup so that way it kind of gives you familiarity to what this pattern looks like across a wide array of different asset classes but I'm covering a simplistic approach to how you should be practicing first and foremost everyone knows broker demo platforms okay so whenever you open up an account with a broker generally they offer you a trial version of their platform so you can test your strategies or whatever it is that you're utilizing for your framework for your setups you can test drive it on a demo account Forex has the ability to offer demo accounts that for some brokers don't expire and it's not a big deal if it does expire you just start another one but you don't want to treat the demo account like monopoly money you want to sit down with it and say okay how much of this hypothetical pretend money would I be utilizing if I was trading it wouldn't have been $50,000 to start with and working with a demo with a sober mind about what you're doing and building good habits and removing the opportunity to fall into bad habits that means over trading looking for setups even after you've made a correct decision and the market shows you that you would have been profitable it's not an invitation to go right back in the same day to try to get something else because it felt good you're going to fall victim to that early on so to avoid all that don't have it in your mindset you have to take a lot of trades every single day you're going to lose a lot of money you don't know it yet but you're going to lose a lot of money trying to do that and third-party apps like forex tester and you can go to forex tester comm and they have a medium where you can go back and back test strategies and such and then finally trading view calm today which doesn't exist at the time of you coming up now Michael the trading view calm website offers pretty much everything that was available when you started meta stock super charts tradestation all those things and bells and whistles that you're liking right now aren't really that important you're going to focus primarily on the open the high the low and the close it doesn't feel like that that's where you're gonna be heading but eventually you're gonna strip all the indicators off your chart Michael and you're not even gonna consider any of it it doesn't make sense to you right now but trust me everything becomes clear by not having anything on your charts you not to have any overlays of your platform indicators you like stochastic right now it's not going to ever appear in your chart anymore you like MACD it's never going to appear on your chart anymore Michael you want to strip the chart down and focus on the for price levels that is the most paramount it's the open the high the low and the close and looking at different intervals the previous day's highs and lows previous weeks highs and lows in previous month's highs and lows will offer a plethora of setups it doesn't feel like that makes sense to you right now but it will absolutely unlock all of the understanding that you'll need the carve-out consistent steady setups so let's go into treating view and look at how we can practice all right so here is the trading view platform and I have the chart set up with the euro dollar currency pair on the left hand side it is a 15-minute time frame and on the right hand side it's a daily chart and the assumption is that we're focusing on the optimal trade entry on a higher time frame until it delivers to a key level and I'm going to show you right now what that would look like here we have a high that would be targeted in here as the price was rallying up we can see before we got to this high back testing these types of setups is what you would be doing we're going to show a Fibonacci on this swing low with dis candles higher low and this candles higher low surrounding this one particular candle that's why I'm anchoring it to that and I'm dragging it all the way up to this candles high because it's as it's making higher highs I'm gonna overlay the fib on every successive higher high because that's going to be the range in which any retracement comes it'll be within that range and it'll be apparent when you see it here so we draw this up so that okay so you can see the Fibonacci that's anchored from this low up to this high it captures this retracement now this candle right here is the 10th of July 2020 here's 10 from the 15 minute sign crane you can see how the 50 minute time frame drops down into the optimal trade entry which is d 60 to 70% of tracing level and 70.5 sweet spot this level is going to be one of the levels you're going to like a lot but you'll save yourself a lot of frustration if you just use the 62 percent treatment level Michael most of the trades that you're hunting in these next couple years are going to be unwilling to traded a seventy point five or even 79 percent treatment level but here just simply used a 62% tracing level and defer the insatiable desire for you to find the perfect entry all the time later on in your 40s you're going to feel real comfortable with not having the absolute best entry and the absolute best exit there's lots and lots of opportunity in between so 62 percent and trade some level one here is ideal and we can actually see a key reaction off that 62% trade some level price starts to move higher now your focus is to imagine every daily candle moving higher open near the low of the day close near the high today up close is the mode of delivery and we're expecting until we get to this high so when we get up to it and through it okay remember that slogan to it and through it to it and through it that's how you're going to find the easiest bread-and-butter setups there is in every market asset class the idea is the framework is this optimal trade entry is going to keep delivering until we get to this high and slightly above it here is 1/2 a standard deviation and it's calling for 1 1446 and 2 pipettes ok the actual high of this price point as of the time of this discussion the high comes in at 114 52 and one pipette so it goes a little bit above it but that's a good idea as a target if not just simply at the old high now we're going to take our concentration away from the daily chart because we can clearly see what the benefit of hindsight here that we had a series of up close candles and each day you'd be hunting in New York setup now this is going to be the easiest framework Michael if you just submit to it early on stop trying to find trades outside of this time frame focus in here and you're going to find everything that you would ever need so all of our attention is going to go over to this chart here so scrubbing forward a little bit you can see the daily dividers and what you're going to do is you're going to take a line segment if you use the rectangle if you want and you're going to delineate on the chart each day 8:30 to 11 o'clock in the morning New York time so when you've studied this time you're going to be able to see a retracement lower because remember that the framework is every day the daily candles are going to go higher that is what you'll later the as the power three this high is going to be attacked but each day is going to be accumulation manipulation and distribution the accumulation is going to be near the love day there are accumulating long positions you're going to see that movement up going into New York New York session is 8:30 to 11 o'clock and as the market retraces lower in there inside that consolidation and retracement you're going to find a five-minute optimal trade entry that means a low swing high down in that doesn't take out the previous swing low trades to the 62 percent retracement level your stop would be below the low that creates the optimal trade entry you would go long at 62 Plus spread and reach for a previous day's high or a combination of that and the standard deviations on the Fibonacci that being like this is one standard deviation this is one half a standard deviation and so on so each day you can start the sea and back test how many pips that using the sixty-two percent in treatment level would give you plus the spread for your entry that you would have risked to get that trade on and how many pips it delivered how long the trade took from entry to delivery to your target how much of a drawdown did each setup take you want to consider that because if you have a large sample set of data not every trades going to start and turn right at the 62% retracement level you might have to incur some drawdown and don't make a big deal of it Michael because you're gonna have a lot of trades and they're not always going to be reacting as soon as you get in many times the fact that they don't react right away is indicative of you being on of you being offside and it's probably better for you to just kill the trade altogether but that's another lesson another time the next day again 8:30 to 11:00 you're going to look for the price structure that London creates a run and then a retracement down into between 8:30 and 11:00 this your optimal trade entry and when you see that again 62% tracing level aiming for a previous day's high previous day's highs here so you're gonna aim for a run through that and then add your standard deviations on your Fibonacci tool for targets same premise how I'm gonna take you to get to profitability and cover the dealer spread how many pips did you incur and draw down how much time did it take to get to target all of that is building up a sample set of backlogs this backlog is what you go back through and study for a hindsight derived experience and by doing this it will program your expectations to not perfect but it will also show like we're showing here an instance where an optimal trade industry doesn't really necessarily perform and even if you use this
