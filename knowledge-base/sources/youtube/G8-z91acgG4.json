folks we're looking at the daily chart for the NASDAQ and if you're looking at trading view under the NASDAQ selection so it's the continuous contract that way it makes all the candles look nice and crisp and you don't see any spotting so right away if you're looking at this you should see this run on price taking out buy side liquidity see all these relative equal highs here ran above it then broke below a swing low created what here got trades up into it now where is it going to trade to this low to this High midpoint there's a gap right there and then you have the old low sell here aim here or here and it runs it out now this is important obviously it sounds like well you know you're cherry picking in imp pack old moves okay that's how you learn but think about what's happened on the daily chart we traded below this low we've taken cell liquidity out of the market Marketplace so with that it's likely to retrace back up into the range what's the range this High to that low but look closer see how we have this nice energetic run look how many down closed candles we have here one two three four lot of movement there so I'm looking at this high and this low and I'm trying to get a range for where we are at present so once the cell side was taken out here it's likely to retrace back inside the range of this high and this low we've seen it come all the way back up it went to a premium Market which is above equilibrium here and then we went down below to a discount bounced off of the old low here then we've Consolidated around equilibrium now when you have this condition it can make it very difficult to get a true reading on bias okay so there's times when even me as ICT I don't have a good clear read on what it is I'm looking for so I have to demand more price action and more information or Intel as I like to call it based on what the Market's going to do right after the open at 9:30 in the morning New York time for disclosure in my own paid membership I mentioned to them that I felt that this was a likely area where they could probably take it down there and sweep that area whether it goes lower or not it's irrelevant but where we were here to here that's what I was expecting some type of move last night for Tuesday's trading okay so Tuesday's trading the 8th of February 2022 going into the marketplace I was anticipating something that would be bearish that's going to be useful to us when we go into lower time frame charts because I'm going to show you what I had to deal with this morning and how I had to overcome that this is something that if you're using these Concepts and practice with your demo account you're going to have these same conundrums and you have to find a way to overcome them and I'm just going to suggest this to you here but before we go into the lower time frames I want to teach bias okay so if we had this setup on a daily chart Market structure has a shift lower we trade up into a fair value Gap until we get down to here and here each day I'm anticipating lower prices so my bias is bearish now every single day is going to be a down Clos candle but I'm going to hunt intraday price action with that in mind if I'm going to take a long it would be counter Trend to that bi my Leverage is going to be dialed back so let's assume for a moment that the account that I was trading with would allow me to trade 10 contracts 10 contracts would be the maximum I could trade so if I'm Trading with the bias which would be bearish during the run from here to here and here then I'm going to look to utilize the maximum leverage that I can have without overleveraging by based on a fixed percentage basis like I like 3 and a half% I'm not telling you to use 3 and a half% you should be risking less than 1% about a half percent or a quarter percent because if you don't know what you're doing there's no reason to be putting High levels of risk behind a move if you don't know what it is you're doing it's going to create toxic thinking bad habits and you're going to be afraid to execute based on the results you're getting so you want to be indifferent to the results that in the beginning is important by having a demo account using very very low leverage if not deleveraging okay and I'll talk a little bit about that when we get into money management but that's not this topic so from this high down to that low each day I'm going in with the expectation that it's going to likely set up a sell scenario where I can get short and hopefully buy back at a lower price count how many up dayss or green Candles there are from this high and this High down to that low one two real important so the delivery by the algorithms are spooling that means prices expanding and going directionally one way when that occurs there's going to be times where you have an up closed candle that may be a day that you tried to go short and maybe you've lost okay no big deal same thing going into the next day going in for looking for shorts next day same thing same thing and then here it opens and trades down below the low and has a huge expansion move and then comes back above and that's it and closes on the near the high of the day or midpoint of the the body in this area here is there a lot of up closed candles during that bias being bearish no you need to get over the concern about being right every single time you need to put aside also the idea of perfection because you're not going to have it perfect you're not going to get in perfectly you're not going to get out perfectly you're not going to have the perfect amount of contracts you're not going to have you know the perfect asset in other words you may be trading the NASDAQ and the e- mini S&P has a little bit better run and delivers a little bit more highly unlikely but vice versa you get what I'm saying so you're you're always going to find reasons to be wrong Embrace imperfection embrace the idea that you don't have to know everything you don't have to be right okay being right is not equivalent to being profitable very important factor there so with bias in short you're looking at your daily chart to get a read on where it's likely to go to next where's the price going to draw is it going to draw higher to an old high is it going to draw down to an old low and until it gets that higher low you stay with that bias okay so it's a quick down and dirty way of interpreting price action for daily bias but the focus that I've taught that are hung up on daily bias really what they're trying to say is and this is exactly what they're getting at but they can't either articulate or they just won't be honest with it or me what they want is tell me how to get the high of the day when it's bearish and how to get out at the low and get all the move and never take a loss and avoid when it's going to be a day that goes against me where I feel comfortable now that might sound extreme and maybe some of you that have issues with daily bias are thinking to yourself that's not me I just want to know when it's going to go up when it's going to go down I'm telling you if you strip it down that's what you're trying to do you're trying to demand that I give you some magic bullet that's going to give you the absolute highest high and the lowest low on the bearish and bullish days so that way you're trading perfectly I don't trade perfectly no one trades perfectly so you have to have this embracing of the gray area in the marketplace that gray area is where things aren't always so clear but because of experience you've had in the past seeing things unfold the way they hopefully would if you've been trained properly then there's nothing to fear even if you do it wrong and you have a adverse reaction or result to taking a trade using the logic that you're training with there's no reason to be fearful because one or two or maybe a small string of losing trades does not in any way shape or form diminish the effectiveness of a model if it's based on Sound Logic so you're going to utilize the daily chart to determine whether or not the next candle is going to be likely bullish or bearish between this High here in the midpoint of this low to high I'm expecting down closed candles that would equate to a bearish bias it doesn't mean that I can't take a long entry it just means that if I do take a long entry in day I'm going to do it with far less leverage and if I see a setup that's bearish I'll use or consider using not always but I'll consider using my maximum risk which is 4 and a half% but I like to see trades that I feel comfortable with with 3 and a half% and until we get down to this low and underneath it that means it's likely to reverse RSE or consolidate and we have a retracement back in So once it starts doing this and it's hanging around equilibrium it gets very difficult even for me to determine a bias so what does that mean no trading no it just means that you have to rely on these smaller time frame intraday charts and just simply look for liquidity pools so you're going to trade intraday volatility running old highs running out old lows being a lot more nimble and like a surgical strike you you take your handles or your points that you're trying to get out of the marketplace and then run you don't try to overstay your welcome so let's go down to a lower time frame all right so we have the 15 minute time frame and we have our 8:30 in the morning crosshairs here crosshairs are the vertical line that denotes the time that we start looking back to the left okay right here go to the left we see here this is our first low so we Mark that and right in here to first to the left is here we don't want to use this low by itself because it's inside of this candle so I want to use the extreme where's the liquidity going to be is it going to be above this or is it going to be above that it's going to be above this okay why why not that one and why this one keep looking left what do you see over here see that these are relative equal highs what does retail Traders see that as resistance so they see it going up to here stopping and going lower they see it going up to here failing to go up here so now they think this is a really strong resistance level and it went lower look at that then the market showed how that level is real resistance by going right through it but this would be a first Target here to reach for and if you want to use a longer term intraday Target would be back here because to the left of this one is this one which essentially is the same then we have this one here okay so obviously with the benefit of hindsight you can see that we traded below that low here then we reversed and started going higher we took out this High here which I traded this I did not hold for this now the question is going to be is why didn't you hold it for that one ICT well if you look at the range from this high down to the low over here about midpoint is just above this high right and we have this little imbalance right there so whatever I'm teaching you in this mentorship I'm looking for about the midpoint and some kind of liquidity there's buy stops above that okay so we traded below I went along on that candle I'll show you in a live account trust me just hear me out I bought a rout up here and I took out on this candle here I got out on that high now I could have held it but to do so would be painting the picture that you can do this and take down these types of Trades all the time and the reality is you're going to require a lot more time to develop than you probably think it will require one of the things that happens when I have students come under my tutelage is they have been fooled by listening to people talk about the left side of the chart all the time and they can't execute on the right side and it is useful in the beginning but if that's all there ever is and if your educator can't trade on the hard right edge of the chart it kind of makes you feel well either a false sense of security or a false sense of confidence that quickly gets evaporated when you trade with a live account or creates analysis paralysis and I have a large body of students that are lumped into one of those categories they've been utilizing some other concept or approach or they call it SMC smart money Concepts and they'll think to themselves that you know this is what's going to have to happen in the chart and it isn't because they're lacking narrative so one of the things that I'm teaching in this mentorship in my paid mentorship is how to view the marketplace from a narrative standpoint what's the logic why should the market do what it's doing it's not enough to see how a low is taken out and the expected to go higher or a high taken out and the expected to go low there has to be some greater context behind it and that's what I gave you in the beginning of the video now on the two-minute chart why the two-minute chart well that's for your homework you go through the five minute the 4 minute the 3 minute the 2 minute and the one minute chart I'm going to utilize the two-minute chart because this is what I was using today for my own analysis okay all right so you can see how we had the old low here we trade down below it and this 10:04 I'm actually highlighting that candle right there the reason why I'm using that candle's low and taking the screen capture there so I want you to see the low candles price okay so that's where your stop would have to be just below that maybe one one tick by going long in here based on the logic I'm going to start to outline here the market trades below the old low trades below it rallies above but does it trade Above This short-term High yet no then it goes down once more below the old low but not below this low here then it turns and goes higher what did I see in this chart that allowed me to go long in here what did I see nothing I didn't see anything in this particular chart I saw it in the S&P before I leave this chart I want you to think about how that high was around this High here that's where it could reach for 830 we're right here what's the point of expecting to go above that not much we want to see some kind of a protraction so the market yes it went above that short-term high and then went lower than that low yes but Watch What Happens it trades below it comes back up and look at all the volatility and the sloppiness inside this area here then the market starts to Rally so the draw in liquidity is going to be here it took out cell side here so let's look inside this price action and see if there's any details that would lead to a run into that we'll call it the 44.95 level okay so the two-minute chart this is what I was using the market trades below the old low as we see here I apologize to screenshot I wish I would have had these things on it but you can look at your two-minute chart on trading View and you'll see this a little bit more clear I apologize but this low C it's high then we have one candle up the next candle is low there's your fair value Gap that's the run in here so we have displacement low and displacement high is there a market structure shift bullish yes it trades up above it and you look for the fair value G is there one in here no anything in here no how about here no it's closed in with this Mo move down here but we have this so we trade down into it here and 1036 that candle forms that's a long in S&P now compare that with this fair value Gap in the S&P we traded below the old low we took sell side out we have a shift in Market structure on the S&P these averages tend to move in tandem so that means they generally move in the same direction so I'm looking at the Dow even though you don't see me trading it I'm looking at it I'm also looking at the S&P even though I'm favoring the NASDAQ because its volatility and its movement is more than the S&P other Traders might be fearful of the volatility say I don't want to trade that it's too fast for me I am loving this because I know how to trade I can work within that volatility because I know what I'm looking for I know the signatures the algorithm is going to put out so until I get these signatures I have to wait or put leaders into the marketplace which is what I'm going to show you when I show you my Live account results today but at 10:36 let's go back up to the NASDAQ we don't see any fair value Gap in there do we nope but we start to see NASDAQ turning so I went in Long in close proximity to this order block okay I went in at 14,505 that's inside of this order block so I'm trading close to it now I promised I wasn't going to teach order blocks that much in this mentorship and some of you have been leaving comments oh I'm not into this now because you're not teaching order blocks okay go watch something else I'm going to teach it the way I want to teach it okay it works and you have to get yourself acclimated to how I'm teaching it or don't watch okay I don't mean to be rude but I'm not taking suggestions on how to teach you so if we are expecting a fair value Gap to be a launching point for the S&P and these markets generally move in tandem I don't need the fair value Gap in the NASDAQ because I'm utilizing the S&P as my indicator what did I just say the word that should not be spoken indicators yeah even though I don't have them plastered all over my charts like graffiti you can see the candlesticks in my charts you can see the logic you can see how the markets run for liquidity there's nothing hiding or masquerading price you can see it it's clear you need that you need to be able to read the story of price and not the story of indicators so the logic is that S&P low in here was trading down into an old fair value Gap over here in its price swing but there is no fair value Gap in the NASDAQ see that now let's go back down into the S&P even my own paid memberships learning something tonight I should have charged money for this one oh ICT fair value Gap trade down into it there that's a long for S&P but I don't want to trade the S&P so I'm going to use the timing of that candle for my long entry on ndaq trading what's not in the chart hint hint nudge nudge so Market rallies and it trades into that short-term high that was seen on let's go back up right here so again just roughing it around that 4496 449 we'll just call it 96 4496 and that would be right in here bang hits it sweeps it accumulat some more and then rallies even higher taking out that longer term old high all right what gave me the confidence that this was turning here well let's take a look at the three averages together if you look at how the Market's trading low here on the Dow this top chart is the Dow futures the NASDAQ futures is in the middle and the S&P is at the lower end here so it's Dow NASDAQ S&P during that decline in the NASDAQ and the S&P look what the Dow's doing it's saying nah I'm going to sit this one out boys it's not willing to make that lower low where NASDAQ did S&P did when you see that right there and here's an important thing you anticipated already you're not looking for this this is what some of my students when they come into my mentorship they see this pattern they think oh it's diverging so it means it's going to go the other direction no this is something that confirms an idea that you had already established before price does what it's doing real time what does that mean you're already looking for a reason to go higher so that means you're looking at an old low does it trade below the old low okay does it have a shift in Market structure that's bullish yes we saw that in the S&P but we did not see it in NASDAQ no evidence whatsoever was in NASDAQ this morning with what I'm teaching you but it was listen it was in the S&P and no I don't trade the Dow but I utilize it like a indicator it's not plastered all over my chart I'm referring to it because I have multiple monitors I'm looking at my screens I have a screen that shows charts like this so I'm looking at the relationship of all three averages stacked over top of one another and if I'm looking at a period of time and an area in price action that maybe is going under accumulation for long positions this is what I'm looking for I'm looking for that little fingerprint of the algorithm what this is indicating is that Dow is unwilling to go lower than that low that tips off individuals that are looking for cracks and correlation okay Cor would be they are moving lower here here and here but they that correlation where they move in tandem together cracks here at a very important time right when the NASDAQ and the S&P are trading below its old low I get questioned all the time ICT how do you know it's going to be a fake Break below and old low and rally higher or or a fake Break above an old high and go lower which is what I dub a turtle soup now that's not the same pattern that is taught in Linda rash and Larry Connor's book Street smarts which is actually an excellent book I have my own interpretation of that which is very easy it's simple there isn't like you know I'm not going to teach their pattern and go buy their book and you support the authors but the idea is I'm looking for runs above old highs to set up a short position if I have the opposite of this condition here where maybe the Dow didn't make a higher High where the S&P and NASDAQ did make a higher high by itself it doesn't mean anything so many students over the years have simply went in there and said oh this is Magic I'm going to go just do that and I unwillingly did the same thing when I first started observing it I'm like I don't need to do anything else I just look for this and it didn't work out well okay I blew accounts yes I'm not ashamed to say it in the '90s I blew accounts doing this very thing here just looking for these diers and then I later learned that I have to have some kind of narrative as to why this would even form and to be honest with you I don't personally need to see this because I know what I'm looking for I already know that it's going to create this Divergence at the times I'm trying to buy but as a developing student you may not have that experience and there's nothing wrong with that and you may have you may been trading longer than me maybe you've been trading 31 years you know uh there's nothing wrong with that maybe you don't need this either but for a developing student someone that doesn't have a affinity for reading price action naked and not using indicators these are the best indicators you're ever going to have you don't need moving averages you don't need stochastic you don't need Fibonacci you don't need in that stuff okay you don't need it the only reason why I'm pulling a fib up is to show you where the midpoint is have you noticed that we haven't even talked about optimal trade entry none of that stuff I've stripped this down to the Chrome and it's beautiful is it not it's easy it's so simple it better be easy enough for my daughter to do it because if you can't do this one I don't have anything for but nonetheless I want you to think about how this pattern confirms the accumulation of long positions now let me correct those of you that are going to take this information and run out there and create your own videos or your own little courses or your own little mentorships okay because if you don't do this right you're going to hurt the people that are listen listening to you and I just don't want them to get hurt because of your lack of understanding what's going on the Dow is not going down because buyers are coming in that's not what's happening here that's what authors and book writers and people that don't really trade or code algorithms will have you believe this is an unwillingness to deliver to that low this is a macro a macro is something inside of an algorithm that prevents or enables delivery delivery of what price so the Dow is unwilling to go lower here okay by itself means nothing does it happen at the same time that the NASDAQ went lower yes at the same time the S&P went lower than that low yes okay so let's go back here's that old low prior to 8:30 remember algorithms run on time and price not price and time multi-level marketers the low that's the price yeah but you have to refer to time first what's the important factor of time 8:30 good to the left what's the first low right there boom so there's liquidity below that it trades below it here then wait do we get a signal that allows us to hunt what I'm teaching you on this mentorship there's a swing High it breaks it there so now Market structure shifted bullish look back through this price leg there's your fair value Gap oh but what happens if it goes down there and it keeps on going that's what your stop is for remember what I said earlier in the video some of you are so new okay your infancy as a Speculator and Trader is it's getting in the way of Sound Logic because what you're thinking is there's a way for you to trade and never take a loss there's a way for you to somehow and this is nowhere near true that you could enter the market and your stop never needs to be placed because you're right because what you're saying is I'm afraid to be wrong that's a psychological barrier that you need to get over because I'm going to show you my Live account and there's going to be some negative numbers there those negative numbers sometimes are premium payments for me to get more Intel okay and with that let's go into the continuation of this all right so here is my Live account and I did some trades this morning I got to my desk a little late this morning couldn't focus I had some expectations I wanted to see it Go lower I told my paid man ship last night that I prefer a move lower uh we got a really sloppy opening which is really characteristic of the 930 opening a lot of people tell you don't trade the 9:30 opening it's scary it's too much volatility I actually don't mind it because I'm actually putting sometimes a order in to get a feel for what it's doing now right away if I just show you this chart and don't give you the context behind it you're going to hear people or they're going to take my video and they're going to do all this armchair quarterback after the fact it's never been traded by them they're not doing a live account they're always playing in demo accounts blowing demo accounts they always have something negative to say about everybody else but they're not doing anything on themselves here's the context that's important okay back in the 90s I learned a lot of things from a Floor Trader that actually traded the S&P on the floor I also picked up more insights from Larry Williams about trading the S&P and also George and gel now George Andel had a really interesting concept when I first heard about it I kind of immediately discounted it I was like that's stupid and what is it well on the floor sometimes Traders would have just a disconnect they wouldn't have a read on what the price is doing so what they would do not just George but everybody on the floor would generally try to do this as well they would simply go in and buy or sell short one contract and just see what happens now for someone that doesn't know what trading is like never traded with life money or just now learning that's going to be like that's stupid if you don't know what you're doing why would you put an order in well if you want to know how the Market's likely to deliver put some skin in the race you'll have a greater feel for what it's doing when you put an order in it doesn't need to be a large order I'm only putting one contract in I can only trade one contract because of the equity I have in the account it's like 21 plus th000 to do one NASDAQ contract and it's Justified because of the volatility you could be up or down $5,000 in a session so you know discount brokers are not a Saving Grace so I put a order in two times I got to my desk late I wanted to dial in and the shest way for me to do that is just to toss a contract in now when I do that I'm trying to read what the price is doing against that order I'm not trying to pick a spot when I'm tossing that in there either now I understand how someone that would never have had any experience trading with real money would look at that and say that's dumb like that's somebody doesn't know what they're doing no you have no idea the benefits of having that it's like dropping a hook in water that you've never fished in you test it see I'm getting any bites here if I throw a short order in or if I throw a long order in I'm watching I'm getting a feel for what the Market's doing once that order's in there and I'm reading the reactions I'm not looking at the equity okay I'm not I'm not trying to get a tug-of-war sensation internally of making money losing money I'm watching how price delivers around that order is it easily moving away from that order or is it lethargically moving away or is it completely running against it that IM that immediate feedback that that feedback loop that it gives you as a a Trader because you have something in there that's worth something you're going to be more attentive to what price is doing and what you're familiar with with reading price than if you were just watching the charts paint the candles and it's something that is true when it comes to like learning with a demo account this is the limitations of learning with a demo because you can test the waters okay by throwing in a single contract and if that contract is is basically you know ran over for a lack of a better term then you know that your bias probably isn't in alignment with that order so if I'm trying to hunt the bigger move of the day I will sacrifice these initial little runs I'm not doing it all the time remember where we started this video we're in the middle of that range on the daily chart so technically it can go either side of the the range and take liquidity I don't know when going to sleep at night time and also when I'm doing videos earlier in the evening I don't know where price is going to be at at 9:30 in the morning New York time the next day I don't know that no one knows that okay no one's going to know that so when I build a trading plan or idea around what I would prefer to see I'm only looking for that the night before everything changes when we walk up to that 8:30 you know vertical line it gets put on my chart to show you now based on those ideas and the relationship of the information I'm getting with that initial contract going in at the opening at 930 I'm getting a read on price sometimes these trades pan out and it's profitable that's not the point and sometimes it creates a small draw down on the account that small draw down if you count that as a skill thing you're missing the point entirely okay if you can get yourself and Avail yourself some you know writings by George Angel invariably you're going to hear him or read him suggesting he's done this and Floor Traders did it as well when I started implementing it and I've done this with Forex too sometimes my students will tell you if we were all in a big Stadium okay and we were all like saying raise your hand if I said this or if I did not say that they would all raise their hand when I say sometimes I'll do this with Forex I just want to know what it's doing I need more information and there's no better feedback loop than to put something at risk in the marketplace CU you don't have anything at risk with a demo you can put a trade on with a demo but you're not really feeling anything from that you're only really drawing a connection when it's right when it's wrong it's just like well whatever I'm not I would have never taken that trade anyway so it's important you know the context here okay with that aside let's move forward so these are me putting in a leader in the market just to see if I can get a better read even though I want to see it going lower I'm not so sure with all this back and forth movement I don't know if it wants to run higher for reach for higher form of buy side liquidity or if it's going to run lower for that low so I tossed in two orders and you can see them when I show you the the history on my next slide but all this went away and then here's where I went short here and I covered basically then I went long right on that candle right there and what was my price ,55 A5 okay and I closed above that high remember the high was at 14620 here it is 14,622 and 3/4 so that's 117 handles I don't care about these little Mickey Mouse moves back here because that is a premium for Intel I'm going to make a small investment to get a better read on these types of moves here okay if I show you these types of charts or I make them available on the internet with no context behind them whatsoever none they would be trolled all day long and they would beat their chest and feel smart like they're saying something that means something they have no idea they have no reason to think that they anything they're saying is valid or true but I'm showing you the logic here okay this is not latency okay when I was doing latency tests that is me testing the feedback timing from putting a trade in how fast I can put orders in what type of slippage I'm getting cuz I have an algorithm and that timing is important for me because this account won't stay at one contract it'll eventually grow till I can do more so I need to know how fast I can ramp it up or is it going to take me a little bit longer term time frame to build it up before I can start pressing it harder everything I'm showing you in this account is All One Mini contract basis not more than one just one because of the leverage and the limitations of margin it won't it it prevents me from doing so okay as you can see it's $ 37,8 2315 and those trades that I showed you on the chart here is that history or whatever the somebody was posting uh show us the history you know it's not a live account unless you can show this area here well here's the trades I've taken for today here was the initial trade here okay you might look at this and say oh man I wouldn't do that pay $750 I'm looking for significant price moves I'm looking at trades that are a little bit more significant intraday because that's the model I'm teaching you now I can teach you a very high frequency type trading style that literally will blow the doors and beat the brakes off of all these supposed algorithms that YouTube's promoting and they won't have have these types of trades in them okay it'll be just real clean like 500 pip $500 runs or $300 runs on equity and then you get in and get out one contract so as you build this up you know 10 contracts it would be easy for you to do3 to $5,000 a day if you take the results I'm showing you here these are the trade results these are my two leaders I put in okay and I got a better feel for what the price was going to do I took the trade here this one here once we got closer to the actual setup around on 10:30 1036 candle these again I was testing whether or not that there's going to be a run now I'm sacrificing this and a little bit more of my starting Equity to get that information because I know if I get the right Intel I know if I'm buying okay I'm going to be buying then I'm going to look at the S&P like I showed you tonight the pattern the setup remember what I was telling you at the beginning of this mentorship this pattern forms every single day but you have to look for it it may not be in your asset it may not be in your particular Market but it exists all of these markets move like boats in a in high tide and low tide all boats rise in high tide all boats drop and lower with low tide so I'm trying to get a read on this environment as a whole not just my own asset class and since I'm trading the NASDAQ I'm not limiting my view or analysis to just NASDAQ there has to be some intermarket relationships okay and I'm combining markets that I'm not even trading like the Dow and the S&P but I'm using the feedback that they're providing me in terms of intermarket relationships so that's what I taught you tonight intermarket relationships and using the consolidation hurdles like when you have a consolidation what do you what you do well this is what I do you know I'll throw a contract in there to see what it's doing and I'll get a feel for that I don't care about draw down because I'm comfortable I can go in and fix the draw down at the end of the year you're going to see that every single day in here there's draw down and I correct it my goal is no losing days now that's not something that you should have as a goal coming out of the gates as a new student I'm not saying that you're ever going to get to that point and I do have losing days but I'm not showing losing days predominantly if I have a losing day here or there it's probably been two since the start of this account I fix the draw down I know how to do that so when I was doing latency tests and I'm testing tdmr trade speed and how they can deal with my positions when I'm getting in getting out getting in getting out I'm getting a read on how fast they can fill me what type of slippage I'm having because when you start doing lots of contracts that's going to mean a whole lot more than just one contract but one contract as you can see here I want to say this real quick and get out of the way um the profits and loss category right there that little tab it's at $ 13,926 that is not a lot of money folks it's not but it's 51 plus per now in two weeks of trading two weeks well two weeks in today days now a day say two weeks and one day so two weeks one day 51% now it's one contract if I was trading with 10 contracts we would be in some serious money then right you start paying more attention to it then right 13,000 almost $14,000 isn't that much money but what happens if you start doing that every single month I'm not suggesting that you can or will or promising that you will but what happens if you do would you make a living on that I'm just asking I put a poll on my community Tab and I asked everyone that would read it is 20% a month return is at a respectable rate of return and if you look at the results it's predominantly yes the other answer was no it's not enough for me now I know there's a lot of trolls that you know like to watch me they'll put whatever the expected adverse choice would be they'll choose that one okay okay but I'm sure there's some of you that think because your first you know impression about trading is everybody gets rich and nobody loses money and everybody gets Lamborghinis in the first three months and it's just great you know nothing nothing bad can happen it's all up from here and I've never been a mentor like that okay I've had very nice flashy things but I don't try to promote that idea I teach you this is going to take a lot of work but the work and the things that are real about this industry and how you're going to have to get like I'm teaching you T night what causes me to get clarity cuz sometimes I don't have it I don't know is something I say periodically and not knowing something is not ignorance it's not an absence of skill it's honesty and you have to be honest with yourself and you cannot assume that you're going to be coming into these markets being perfect because perfect is not something that exists in trading it does not exist there is never going to be someone that's perfect you're in this industry to do what make money that's it if you're in here for any other reason I'm in here to impress my dad impress my mom my girlfriend boyfriend husband whatever old gym teachers that's the wrong reason because you're doing things from an emotional high and when you have the emotional low it really hurts and you need to keep yourself focused on why you're doing this your you're doing it to make money to improve your financial condition like I mentioned before I start this mentorship I believe that there are hard times coming ahead and you don't need to make $144,000 in two weeks you don't need that but if you make your car note for the month or if you make 50% of your mortgage or rent payment every month with something like this and I'm not saying or promising you can but think like that let it evolve from that when I was a young man and I said this many times in my uh videos and I have some people in this uh mentorship that are watching that they don't like when I do these types of Rants and things and they say oh stick to the topic blah blah blah get to the point this is the point okay because you're going to if you're not trading with life money right now inconsistent you're going to have these things come up in your own thinking and they're going to be barriers so what when that happens you're going to be wanting to email me okay or you're going to wrestle with it and not know how to deal with it when I first started back when I was 20 years old I'm looking at the market thinking if I can get to the point where I could save $1,000 a month by the time I'm in my 40s I won't need to work now obviously you I didn't factor in inflation all that stuff but a million dollars by 40 you know that was enough for me to get to work and focus on learning how to do this contrast that with what you see on YouTube today follow my signal service join my mentorship I made $60,000 in one trade here's the proof here's the withdrawal here's this here's that that is not something that is sustainable and it's such a wild unicorn that just pops up once in a while you don't see these people pulling out $60,000 consistently every single week that's not happening okay but I'm pulling out $6,000 a week consistently now that's not a lot of money it's not but I'm quite confident in saying that I think that the majority of you and I'm talking the high 90% of you could live pretty nice on $6,000 a week will the market continuously offer me $6,000 I don't know I haven't traded the indices in a long time but I traded these markets 30 years ago okay and I know them so I'm not scared of them I'm not scared of the volatility I love it but if you look at the relationship ship of how these negative trades give me Intel they give me Insight because I'm trying to get a read on the next swing on that daily chart these are all small little Investments on me getting a better read on that see you think that your trading accounts never going to have any of these in them when these are to a informed Trader someone that's seasoned that knows what they're doing they'll invest in their own Trading think about what I'm telling you you're investing in yourself to get more information that you can't collect just by watching the price action so you got to get a closer feel for it and you invest and you put something in the marketplace now there are trades and I've mentioned this uh I'm not sure which video it was in the mentorship but I did one and they were losing trades they were they were wrong ideas they were absolutely wrong ideas not all of a losing trade record is errors and that's how it's important because if you just look at somebody's you know trading statements or or well yeah their positions and and their statements that's not going to give you the context that would be required like I could look at someone's statement and say okay yeah they're making money but in reality unless I look at what they're doing on a chart they could be lucky they could be just getting lucky and this today was me investing in trying to get a feel for what I think is going to happen on the next few days worth of data and I'll throw in a couple trades where it doesn't matter to me if I'm losing and sometimes when I do this they're winning trades but they're not meant to be winning trades or losing trades it's just me getting a read on it now when you do a micro account okay it wouldn't be this much money and you may not trade with this style this I know many of my students don't do this because they just don't think it's a worthwhile investment but those same traders that are under my toist are not capturing 100 plus handle moves in these indices either so it's a tradeoff okay what is it you're trying to do what are you trying to accomplish I'm not trying to get 10 handles you know on a lot of contracts and scalp scalp scalp okay I know what I'm looking for and this this tab over here where it says profit and losses I don't care how much money I deposit in the account the broker will never put that money in that tab so when you read people making comments on the internet and I have a few of them in the in the previous video that I mentioned and showed today where I was showing my Live account logging into in the whole show they said that I'm adding money and this is reflecting the additions and that just proves that these people have no idea what a live account looks like they've never seen one in their life no broker ever would ever reflect deposits in the profits and loss category that would never happen and this is absolutely profits and in organizations like the cftc would literally come after me or anybody else if that wasn't real money I'd be breaking the law by saying it is real money that's real profits right there okay these trades here I cleaned up all of this with that trade right there okay but I I want to give something that I think and believe that is realistic my int intentions are not to run this account up to a million dollar because I don't think that you learning from this YouTube channel that that is realistic can some of you do it well the sky is not the limit okay I've on record many times saying that I have students that do very very well I have students that don't make money at all now you might be an exception I don't know that you may believe it I don't know okay but the things I'm teaching on this YouTube channel I have faith in that's the only thing I'm showing you here I'm not saying look what I can do so therefore you can do it too I cannot promise you that you're going to get the same results in fact I'm promising you that you won't get the same results as me okay but I try to trade this account with the expectation also that I don't want it to be consistently over and over again where it's just too good to be believable because I want you to be able to see these statements at the end of the year and look at them and refer to them and say you know what there's these times in the market in certain months and certain days where there was draw down in this account and it came out of that draw down and look where it ended for the year look where it ended for each month that is tangible real world help when you feel like if you have a losing streak or if you have losing trades and you look at someone that's been able to use the logic that I'm teaching you and still correct it now I can correct the draw down intraday because I know how to trade very well I'm not bragging it's just the facts if I know what I'm looking for whatever draw down I have and I can correct the intraday draw down that I've had on the chart if we look at how the market can give us these opportunities and you can see that this trade here there's that entry at 14,505 and a half right there 14,622 and 3/4 right here that was the sell that was the exit here's the commission costs here's the fees and here's the commission that TDM trade takes out and here's the return on that one trade 2345 $2,345 that cancels out all of the leaders I put in to get a feel for it and I pocketed $1,100 for one day for a short amount of time I could have held it I could have done that using what I'm teaching you here but I'm trying to teach by example so that way you don't look at me do unrealistic things that you can't do right away do I believe someone that has put a year into trading and studying what I'm doing with this mentorship can trade like this I personally believe yes but does that mean that you are all going to do it no if I didn't believe you could do it I wouldn't be up here doing it okay the logic is being shown to you I showed you in the charts how I use the S&P to time my NASDAQ trade and here are the actual history this is this is it okay I got asked Today Show this okay here it is do the numbers here add them up and then add it to that profit and look at the video I just posted today and some of you going to say oh this is a you said uh photoshopped pH phoshop thing because it's on your PowerPoint I do PowerPoint because I'm not having to worry about hiding my user number because if I hide that then you can't see all the the other details down here I think it's what turns off so I want to keep everything so you can see it so it just allows me to not worry about it but nonetheless I want you to think about how daily bias is not an everyday bias that's going to work in your favor some days I go in I'm expecting like last night I preferred to see the market go a little bit lower and it didn't deliver so I had to make adjustments and then I caught myself on the right side of the daily range exiting where I teach you getting in where I teach you right there there's logic it's that's the proof okay um there will be days where I try to do this and I'm going to have a losing day it will happen I will not be able to corrected it will be a losing negative day when that happens the first instance that that happen s I'm going to show you it okay I'm not trying to hide the losing days but the trader in me the person that is ICT I refuse if I have the capability I refuse to let my negative day stay negative at the close now you might look at that as oh well you're you know you can't accept the losing trade and you're trading emotional that's nonsense this is someone that's got three decades of experience and I know how to fix it so if you knew how to fix it wouldn't you do it right so again everybody's going to have an opinion and everybody's going to have a way of thinking how they need to be taught but I've been doing this for a very long time and I'm not going to change my style so the order of which I'm teaching it the topics I'm talking about the way I'm showing it to you in the charts that's how I'm trading I'm putting the trades on based on that logic so that way you can see I have faith in this you may not have faith in this you may never take these trades you may never ever put any effort into learning them you're just watching this like it's a Netflix binge watching scen you scenario okay that's cool but this is something that is transferable I can do it it will repeat to answer your questions I'm getting a lot of comments also and I'm going to close the video here the algorithms are not going to change because ICT is teaching teaching you how to navigate with them period why am I trading these markets when I'm supposed to be the Forex Guru well if you look at Forex Forex is going real quiet it's sideways so I'm going to trade this Market also as a compare and contrast I've been doing this Market a lot longer than Forex again I started with these markets here and bonds which when we get into uh May and June I'll probably trade some Bonds in here as well give you some tips on on how that market Works a little bit too but hopefully you got something from this I was a little all over the place but I wanted to be relaxed and and communicate a lot of things that were coming to me by way of the comment section I appreciate all of your comments I appreciate all of the feedback you guys are giving me um just so you know I know some of you are probably leaving these sweet Sugar Rush uh comments and really really lavishing me with adoration I'm not trying to put those comments I always accept one comment for each video as a way of you know saying I liked your comment you know I think that's a a significant comment that I think the community would appreciate not just oh this is you know loving ICT um I appreciate all of that but just know that those types of comments are never going to be allowed to be shown um I I'm holding all the comments for review because I still have some terrible things being said to me to me that are not true and I'm not going to give a stage for that okay um in closing if anybody out there says that they're doing trades that are live and they making $220,000 a day or whatever and they're not doing it in a simulator let them Show You by logging into a live account and doing it like this I'd be interested to see that also until next time be safe"
